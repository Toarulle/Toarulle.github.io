Her piercing eyes darted about the page in search of ideas to explore. Finding none, she moved to a new sheet and put the old one atop the stack to the side.She stared at the now empty parchment in front of her and twirled the stick of charcoal in her hand. Her feathers were ruffled and the rings on her swinging tail clinked softly as they moved back and forth in concentration.The sound of hammers against metal could be heard from the workshop below, resonating with a familiar rhythm and ringthat matched the pace of her thought, charcoal, and tail. She wasa pendulum in motion: a clock that counted down to the stroke of brilliance, and when it rang out, the satisfied trills of victory would echo throughout the chamber.Vyrre Olmeck, The Face of CreationFeathren are the representation of something new from something old. A step beyond their ancestral griffon heri- tage, these bipedal creatures celebrate their individuality amidst the cries and jeers from common folk. Originally bornfrom the Astral Plane, where all things can be lost, found, and remade, feathren now walk the Material Plane in search of new ideas, materials, and direction. Filled with endless curiosity, many make their way through the world as adven- turers and artisans, taking care to learn what they can from their experiences before moving on to the next one.Feathren unite remarkable aspects of two otherwise disparate species. Their strong legs are feline, while their chest, arms, and head are avian. Despite their distant relation to griffons, feathren stand upright and can use their sharp talons to manipulate objects as deftly as any other humanoid. Their voices often bear some bird-like resemblance to their ancestry and contain the occasional trill, coo, or caw.Few feathren look the same. Their fur, plumage, and build can vary widely, forming unique combinations of origin and aptitude. While some feathren are born with the body of an eagle and lion, others combine the likes of owls and crows with tigers and leopards. Feathren find particular pleasure in jewelry and decoration: an inescapable personality trait from their heritage. Without wings to embellish, most turn to adorning themselves with baubles and rings on their talons, feathered ears, and tail. Others enjoy body art, such as tattoos, paints, and other unique means of self expression. Most feathren struggle to resist the urge to preen or adjust their worn finery whenever they catch a glimpse of their reflection.Born with the innate gifts of two naturally skilled creatures, feathren have a shared sense of confidence in their abilities. Feathren spend their lives learning and mastering new trades to sate their curiosity, preferring to answer a puzzle or ques- tion on their own rather than ask for help. Many feathren find camaraderie among those that share a common passion, and while they're remiss to turn to peers for help, they enjoy the sharing of stories and conversation about their interests.As is their nature, feathren enjoy experimenting with names and playing with the combinations they can make with them. Feathren are given a name at birth that's used as a first name, but give themselves new surnames as they grow.Throughout a feathren's lifespan, they may go through as many as twenty surnames: some may last for years, while others are kept for mere weeks. These names are typically combinations of words that describe them and act as either loose titles or personal mantras, and can come from a variety of languages.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Feathren","level":1,"id":"Feathren_1"},{"heading":"FEATHREN","level":1,"id":"FEATHREN_0"},{"heading":"VARIED HERITAGE","level":2,"id":"VARIED_HERITAGE_0"},{"heading":"CONFIDENT AND CURIOUS","level":2,"id":"CONFIDENT_AND_CURIOUS_0"},{"heading":"FEATHREN NAMES","level":2,"id":"FEATHREN_NAMES_0"},{"heading":"<em>Male Names: Acero, Astraios, Caicias, Cleve, Fhyriad, Gyrin, Iapet, Ipsideo, Jurat, Klost, Lostro, Quyll, Ronta, Strey, Untreyo, Yulla, Zwayne</em>","level":4,"id":"*Male_Names_Acero,_Astraios,_Caicias,_Cleve,_Fhyriad,_Gyrin,_Iapet,_Ipsideo,_Jurat,_Klost,_Lostro,_Quyll,_Ronta,_Strey,_Untreyo,_Yulla,_Zwayne*_0"},{"heading":"<em>Female Names: Accra, Axellia, Coora, Ereya, Finneli, Fuli, Herata, Hyla, Juip, Leies, Lucine, Lustra, Monit, Omi, Parra, Reyda, Velrin</em>","level":4,"id":"*Female_Names_Accra,_Axellia,_Coora,_Ereya,_Finneli,_Fuli,_Herata,_Hyla,_Juip,_Leies,_Lucine,_Lustra,_Monit,_Omi,_Parra,_Reyda,_Velrin*_0"},{"heading":"<em>Example Surnames: Birthwoven, Crownfeather, Downy, Gemcrest, Ghostwing, Goldtail, Mistwalker, Ricket, Rightedge, Starborn, Wavecrushed</em>","level":4,"id":"*Example_Surnames_Birthwoven,_Crownfeather,_Downy,_Gemcrest,_Ghostwing,_Goldtail,_Mistwalker,_Ricket,_Rightedge,_Starborn,_Wavecrushed*_0"}],"links":[],"author":"Rasmus","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/01_pcs/singwin-mistwalker-folder/race-info/feathren.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1730964969144,"modifiedTime":1693322032668,"sourceSize":4302,"sourcePath":"01_PCs/Singwin Mistwalker-folder/Race Info/Feathren.md","exportPath":"01_pcs/singwin-mistwalker-folder/race-info/feathren.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":142,"backlinks":["03_npcs/saxicus.html","03_npcs/semil-wildmagic.html"],"type":"markdown"},"01_pcs/singwin-mistwalker-folder/race-info/feathren-traits.html":{"title":"Feathren - Traits","icon":"","description":"Your Feathren character has a variety of natural abilities as a result of its unique mix of avian and feline ancestry.Your ability scores increase depending on your Feathren ancestry. Use the Feathren Ancestry tables to determine your combination of physical features and corresponding ability score increases, choosing one Avian option and one Feline option.Young feathren are born from eggs and mature more quickly than humans do, reaching maturity by age 8 and typically living to be around 70.Feathren can be mercurial and admire variety and expression, and as a result tend to lean towards the gentler aspects of chaos. They are more often good than not, although some allow their vanity to turn to greed and evil.Feathren typically range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall with a range of builds based on their ancestry, usually weighing between 100 and 200 pounds. Your size is Medium.Your base walking speed is 30 feet.Your mix of predatory blood has given you eyes that can cut through darkness. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.You have proficiency in two artisan's tools of your choice, and can gain proficiency in a new tool in half the normal amount of time.Your talons are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal slashing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.Due to your curious lineage stemming from the Astral Plane, you have a limited ability to magically harness the stardust that exists within all things. You can cast identify and enhance ability with this trait, without requiring material components. Once you cast either spell, you can't cast that spell again with this trait until you finish a long rest.You have the ability to communicate in a limited manner with cats and birds that are Large or smaller, including griffons. They can understand the meaning of your words, though you have no special ability to understand them in return. You have advantage on all Charisma checks you make to influence them. You can speak, read, and write Common and one extra language of your choice. When choosing a language to study, feathren tend to value the sounds they make more highly than their practicality.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Ability Score Increase","level":3,"id":"Ability_Score_Increase_0"},{"heading":"Avian Feathren Ancestry","level":3,"id":"Avian_Feathren_Ancestry_0"},{"heading":"Feline Feathren Ancestry","level":3,"id":"Feline_Feathren_Ancestry_0"},{"heading":"Age","level":3,"id":"Age_0"},{"heading":"Alignment","level":3,"id":"Alignment_0"},{"heading":"Size","level":3,"id":"Size_0"},{"heading":"Speed","level":3,"id":"Speed_0"},{"heading":"Darkvision","level":3,"id":"Darkvision_0"},{"heading":"Natural Creator","level":3,"id":"Natural_Creator_0"},{"heading":"Talons","level":3,"id":"Talons_0"},{"heading":"Astral Ancestry","level":3,"id":"Astral_Ancestry_0"},{"heading":"Kindred Speech","level":3,"id":"Kindred_Speech_0"},{"heading":"Languages","level":3,"id":"Languages_0"}],"links":[],"author":"Rasmus","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/01_pcs/singwin-mistwalker-folder/race-info/feathren-traits.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1730964968628,"modifiedTime":1760606694672,"sourceSize":3398,"sourcePath":"01_PCs/Singwin Mistwalker-folder/Race Info/Feathren - Traits.md","exportPath":"01_pcs/singwin-mistwalker-folder/race-info/feathren-traits.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":143,"backlinks":["01_pcs/singwin-mistwalker-folder/character-sheet.html","01_pcs/singwin-mistwalker-folder/while-playing/character-sheet.html","02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-33-2023-10-07.html"],"type":"markdown"},"01_pcs/singwin-mistwalker-folder/while-playing/character-sheet.html":{"title":"Character Sheet","icon":"","description":"\nHas not been used\n(Filled) is unavailable Rod of the Pact Keeper - Reset on Long rest Eaglereign\nRod of the Pact Keeper\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Items.canvas\" data-href=\"Items.canvas\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/01_pcs/singwin-mistwalker-folder/while-playing/items.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Illusionists Bracers</a>\nDark Leather Armor Identify\nDetect Magic\nBlink\nFly\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Session 28 - 2023-07-28 > ^f086ad\" data-href=\"Session 28 - 2023-07-28#^f086ad\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-28-2023-07-28.html#^f086ad\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Secret Chest</a>\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Session 44 - 2024-02-04 > ^newunlocks\" data-href=\"Session 44 - 2024-02-04#^newunlocks\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-44-2024-02-04.html#^newunlocks\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Dimension Door</a>\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Session 44 - 2024-02-04 > ^newunlocks\" data-href=\"Session 44 - 2024-02-04#^newunlocks\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-44-2024-02-04.html#^newunlocks\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Divination</a> Money: 100GP\nDiamonds: 1x 10GP\n1x 50GP Other shiny rocks 8x 25GP Metals 1x 40GP Bard-In-A-Box\nRandom-stuff 200GP\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Session 28 - 2023-07-28 > ^feedbag\" data-href=\"Session 28 - 2023-07-28#^feedbag\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-28-2023-07-28.html#^feedbag\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Horned Devil’s Bident</a>\nRing of Soul Storing\nPendant of the Tempered Fury\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Session 42 - 2024-01-12 > ^feedbag\" data-href=\"Session 42 - 2024-01-12#^feedbag\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-42-2024-01-12.html#^feedbag\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Tome of Astral Wonderings &amp;

Roll for both manufacturing and enchanting quirks Jag kan öka eller sänka resultatet med upp till halva min proficiency bonus om jag vill. Boons or flaws gained from enchanting are more complicated. If the item is attuneable, then the boon or flaw is only applied to a creature while it is attuned to the item. If the item is consumable (e.g., a potion, food, or scroll), then the quirk is present for the duration of the item’s effect or, if the item has no duration (like a potion of healing), 1 hour. If the item is neither attuneable nor consumable, then the quirk is active while the item is in the creature’s possession, whether it is being held, carried, or worn. The list of possible enchanting quirks can be found in the tables on pages 118 - 119. The number of enchantment boons a magic item can sustain depends on the power of the essence used to craft the item.Flaws and boons generated by manufacturing checks are mundane. They are always active whenever the item is being used. The list of possible manufacturing quirks can be found in the tables on pages 116 - 117.Quirks are properties that the item possesses. They can only be removed by redoing the crafting check used in their creation. Redoing a manufacturing check takes the same tools required to craft the item. Redoing an enchanting check requires a fresh essence of the same level for the item’s rarity. When the crafting check is made, the old flaws and boons are removed, and new ones are applied based on the result of the check.Things that are well or poorly crafted cost more or less, respectively. For each boon or flaw an item has, additively increase or decrease its value by 10%, respectively. A flame tongue longsword with 3 manufacturing boons (+30%) and 2 enchanting flaws (-20%) would cost 10% more, overall. Note: commissioning an item is a gamble; the cost a character pays doesn’t change if the item ends up with quirks. However, a blacksmith that makes an exquisite suit of armour outside of a commission can price it as they wish.This section contains all the tables needed to determine which quirks to apply to a crafted item and any random factors those quirks might require. If an enchanting quirk calls for a saving throw, the DC depends on the item’s rarity. Consult the Item Save DCs table on page 120.Repeated Results. In general, quirks don’t stack; if the crafter rolls the same quirk for an item more than once, they roll again until they get a unique result. The exceptions for this are manufacturing flaws with results of 1-10: Handiwork, Fragile, and Unwieldy. If the Handiwork flaw is rolled more than once, the effects are cumulative (-1/-2/-3 penalty). If the Fragile or Unwieldy flaws are rolled more than once, the number on the d20 required to trigger the associated effect increases by 1 for each subsequent iteration of the flaw. For example, a longsword with 3 Fragile flaws would break on an attack roll of 1, 2, or 3.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Crafting Quirks","level":2,"id":"Crafting_Quirks_0"},{"heading":"Enchanted Quirks.","level":3,"id":"Enchanted_Quirks._0"},{"heading":"Manufactured Quirks.","level":3,"id":"Manufactured_Quirks._0"},{"heading":"Removing Quirks.","level":3,"id":"Removing_Quirks._0"},{"heading":"Optional Rule: Quirks &amp; Costs.","level":3,"id":"Optional_Rule_Quirks_&_Costs._0"},{"heading":"Quirk Tables","level":2,"id":"Quirk_Tables_0"},{"heading":"Manufacturing Flaws","level":3,"id":"Manufacturing_Flaws_0"},{"heading":"Manufacturing Boons","level":3,"id":"Manufacturing_Boons_0"}],"links":[],"author":"Rasmus","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/01_pcs/singwin-mistwalker-folder/while-playing/crafting.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1730964968617,"modifiedTime":1752934485826,"sourceSize":16867,"sourcePath":"01_PCs/Singwin Mistwalker-folder/While Playing/Crafting.md","exportPath":"01_pcs/singwin-mistwalker-folder/while-playing/crafting.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":146,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"01_pcs/singwin-mistwalker-folder/while-playing/feats.html":{"title":"Feats","icon":"","description":"\nIncrease your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.\nYou learn the <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:misty-step\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:misty-step\" target=\"_self\">Misty Step</a> spell and one 1st-level spell of your choice.

The hook is the same piece as in the Hookshot property, that gets launched as a weapon.\nThe prosthesis is a ranged weapon that uses your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You’re considered proficient with this weapon. The portion of the prosthesis used to attack is automatically reeled in immediately after.\nIf you are not holding an item:\nYou can shoot the hook at a fixed surface within range as a bonus action, or as a reaction when falling. The hook then attaches to that surface until you use a bonus reaction to detach the hook and reel the rope back in, or until the rope is destroyed. The rope is an object with AC 10 and 10 hp.\nYou can fire the hook at another creature at least two sizes larger than you, making an attack roll with the prosthesis. You’re considered proficient with the attack, which uses your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack roll. On a hit, it deals no damage, but the hook attaches to the target. A creature within 5 feet of the hook can use an action to forcefully detach the hook with a successful DC 10 Strength or Dexterity Check.\nWhile the hook is attached, you have advantage on ability checks made to move along the rope, such as climb a vertical surface, swin against a current, or walk against a strong wind. You can’t move or be moved more than the hookshot’s range away from the point to which the hook is attached.\nIf you’re falling, you stop falling further than the range at which you shot the hookshot and become suspended from the surface the hook is attached to.

Oftast metalliska vapen av olika slag, men även verktyg och andra tillbehör. De båda var Smiths under PCs uppväxt.Deras verkstad hette \"Snowtails' Solid Stuff\". De var en hyllad verkstad i sin del av staden. Rykte spred sig ibland långa vägar och de fick besök från flera veckors färd bort, för de ville ha just deras prylar.PC växte upp och flyttade ut, skapade sin egen verkstad i annan stad. Bytte efternamn till Redcap och i samband öppnade Redcap's Rapiers.Ett par veckor senare kommer det in en kund i butiken utöver det vanliga. En annan Feathren har PC inte sett på länge i sin verkstad. Raven-överkropp och Panther-ben. Hon var en snickare (Carpenter) som var väldigt duktig med vagnar (Wagons) men även annat i trä.Hej hopp de blev tsm o de öppnade en ny verkstad ihop med nya namnet \"Willowwrights' Wagons and Weapons\". De bytte alltså båda namn till Willowwright oxå i samband med att de började leva tsm.Tjej dör.Frustrerad, ledsen.blackoutByter namn till MistwalkerWakes up with BagWhat now?","aliases":["Singwin","Singwin Mistwalker"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"Rasmus","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/01_pcs/singwin-mistwalker-folder/singwin-mistforger.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1730964968335,"modifiedTime":1699612094261,"sourceSize":2715,"sourcePath":"01_PCs/Singwin Mistwalker-folder/Singwin Mistforger.md","exportPath":"01_pcs/singwin-mistwalker-folder/singwin-mistforger.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":155,"backlinks":["01_pcs/singwin-mistwalker-folder/singwin-mistforger.html","02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-00-2022-08-13.html","02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-01-2022-08-16.html","02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-02-2022-08-23.html","02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-03-2022-09-04.html","02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-04-2022-09-25.html","02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-05-2022-10-09.html","02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-06-2022-11-16.html","02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-07-2022-11-26-ärkedruiden-darby.html","02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-08-2022-12-19-brogho-(knarklangning).html","02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-09-2023-01-06.html","02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-10-2023-01-14.html","02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-11-2023-01-29.html","02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-12-2023-02-18.html","02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-13-2023-03-04.html","02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-14-2023-03-10.html","02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-15-2023-03-25.html","02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-16-2023-04-02.html","02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-17-2023-04-15-olof-dm.html","02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-18-2023-04-23-olof-dm.html","02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-19-2023-05-05-olof-dm.html","02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-20-2023-05-15.html","02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-21-2023-05-23.html","02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-22-2023-05-28-maskerad.html","02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-23-2023-06-10.html","02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-24-2023-06-17-lan-session-med-johan.html","02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-25-2023-06-20-lizardpeople-in-the-desert.html","02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-26-2023-07-17-johan-inte-med,-gol-spelas-av-jacob.html","02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-27-2023-07-24.html","02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-36-2023-11-03.html","02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-37-2023-11-26.html","02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-38-2023-12-03.html","02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-39-2023-12-18.html","02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-40-2023-12-26.html","02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-41-2024-01-05.html","02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-42-2024-01-12.html","02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-43-2024-01-28.html","02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-44-2024-02-04.html","02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-45-2024-02-10.html","02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-46-2024-03-02.html","02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-47-2024-03-23.html","02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-48-2024-08-23-starting-the-orc-infiltration-arc.html","02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-49-2025-06-08.html","02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-50-2025-06-22-start-of-the-tyrfindal-arc.html","02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-51-2025-07-13.html","02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-52-2025-07-27.html","02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-53-2025-09-14.html","02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-54-2025-10-13.html","02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-55-2025-10-26.html","02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-56-2025-11-03.html","02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-57-2025-11-22.html","02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-58-2025-12-08.html"],"type":"markdown"},"01_pcs/singwin-mistwalker-folder/the-astral-griffon.html":{"title":"The Astral Griffon","icon":"","description":"Throughout the ever-expanding multiverse, new and powerful forces emerge as quickly as they're vanquished. These great creatures, be they mortals, demigods, or gods themselves,canmakeasgoodanallyastheycana terrifying adversary.You may find yourself called to serve one of these new figures as a bound subject, forging a pact to wield some of this great new power. While sheer might is always admirable, the wisdom to choose the right path is always more so.You have made a pact with a powerful demigod of the Astral Plane: a Griffon whose control over space, creation, and pocket dimensions extends throughout the multiverse. It aims to expand its eclectic collection of treasures, both magical and mundane. These treasures may be worth very little in the average shop, but to the Griffon it holds a special place in history or the fabric of existence. Your binding may lead you far and wide in search of foreign artifacts as quickly as it would a nearby pub for a tarnished locket. Regardless of the task, the Griffon's aims are rarely subject to distinctly good or evil motives.The Astral Griffon lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.At 1st level, your patron grants you the ability to maintaina small pocket dimension. The extradimensional space is always accessible to you and can hold up to 50 pounds of in- animate material, not exceeding 1 cubic foot. You can access and interact with this space using your hands the same way you would with a normal container. Your hands disappear within the space while they're accessing it.Placing a bag of holding, handy haversack, portable hole, or similar item inside your pocket dimension instantly destroys both the item and anything else within the two extradimensional spaces. When this happens, you are unable to access your pocket dimension again until 7 days have passed.In addition, you can sense whether pocket dimensions are present within 60 feet of you. This feature doesn't reveal their location or number.By 6th level, you can hide yourself in a temporary extradimensional space to avoid harm. When you take damage from a hostile creature you can see within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to disappear into a harmless pocket dimension. You can see into your original plane of existence and move normally while in this extradimensional space, but other creatures can neither see nor harm you while you remain there. You remain in this pocket dimension until the end of your next turn or until you attack or cast a spell. Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.Starting at 10th level, the fabric of existence is clear to you. You have resistance to force damage, and whenever you discover an extradimensional space, you can perceive what items are stored within it.In addition, you can use an action to enhance your perception of reality. For 10 minutes, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight, and you gain truesight out to 30 feet. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.At 14th level, you've learned how to mold extradimensional spaces beyond their normal limits. Your pocket dimension expands to hold up to 250 pounds, or 10 cubic feet.In addition, you can use an action to shunt an object that isn't being worn that you can see within 30 feet of you into your pocket dimension, provided that there's enough space. If the object is being carried, the holder must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. The object remains in the extradimensional space until the end of your next turn or until you retrieve it. When the effect ends, the object reappears in an unoccupied space within5 feet of you or in your hands, if you have any free (your choice). Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"WARLOCK","level":1,"id":"WARLOCK_0"},{"heading":"THE ASTRAL GRIFFON","level":2,"id":"THE_ASTRAL_GRIFFON_0"},{"heading":"Expanded Spell List","level":3,"id":"Expanded_Spell_List_0"},{"heading":"Astral Griffon Expanded Spells","level":3,"id":"Astral_Griffon_Expanded_Spells_0"},{"heading":"Extradimensional Acuity","level":3,"id":"Extradimensional_Acuity_0"},{"heading":"Planar Escape","level":3,"id":"Planar_Escape_0"},{"heading":"Extradimensional Mastery","level":3,"id":"Extradimensional_Mastery_0"},{"heading":"Pocketeer","level":3,"id":"Pocketeer_0"}],"links":[],"author":"Rasmus","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/01_pcs/singwin-mistwalker-folder/the-astral-griffon.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1730964969170,"modifiedTime":1705083948627,"sourceSize":4606,"sourcePath":"01_PCs/Singwin Mistwalker-folder/The Astral Griffon.md","exportPath":"01_pcs/singwin-mistwalker-folder/the-astral-griffon.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":156,"backlinks":["01_pcs/singwin-mistwalker-folder/warlock.html"],"type":"markdown"},"01_pcs/singwin-mistwalker-folder/warlock.html":{"title":"Warlock","icon":"","description":"Warlocks are seekers of the knowledge that lies hidden in the fabric of the multiverse.

It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die.\nYou can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest.\nYou can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter. You can't affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way.

Pact of the Tome Your patron gives you a grimoire called a Book of Shadows. When you gain this feature, choose three cantrips from any class's spell list (the three needn't be from the same list). While the book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They don't count against your number of cantrips known. If they don't appear on the warlock spell list, they are nonetheless warlock spells for you.\nIf you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book turns to ash when you die.

This benefit can be used a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and all expended uses are restored when you finish a long rest.\nIf you lose the talisman, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron.

Choose one 6th-level spell from the warlock spell list as this arcanum.You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again.At higher levels, you gain more warlock spells of your choice that can be cast in this way: one 7th-level spell at 13th level, one 8th-level spell at 15th level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th level. You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a long rest.At 20th level, you can draw on your inner reserve of mystical power while entreating your patron to regain expended spell slots. You can spend 1 minute entreating your patron for aid to regain all your expended spell slots from your Pact Magic feature.

Some go so far as to suggest that they are far t oo trusting and lack any caution in dealing with outsiders - a trait that has led to tragedy more than once. Despite this, cappy society never loses its optimistic glimmer for long as steadfast refusal to judge the many by the few stands as one of the pillars of their community. Though repeat offenders are given little leeway before enough is enough and even the cappy are driven to anger. They are uniformly vegetarian, highly social and seem to possess a natural affinity for the simple creatures that exist alongside them. Cappy populaces are usually gentle and unassuming communities, rarely committing to violence in any meaningful way, but are often made up of farmers, fisherfolk, priests and affable wayfarers offering aid to wayfarers in need. Cappy communities are almost exclusively located near large bodies of fresh water, in which family groups spend much of their time each day. Those rare few that are located elsewhere have large common bathing facilities that utilize water conjured by magic or simply carriedBathing areas are important community locations where cappy villagers meet and make collective decisions in a relaxed environment. Decisions are by consensus, and the cappy are known for never explicitly arguing – an atmosphere that can be either relaxing or infuriating to a participant, depending on their stake in what is being discussed. by hand overland. Cappy kept away from their beloved baths for too long are prone to uncharacteristic irritability brought about by parasites or skin lesions.Cappy have an innate empathy for living creatures that puts beasts as ease around them. Even normally dangerous, wild creatures have been known to traipse into and laze about their villages without any hint of aggression towards the villagers or other creatures in the vicinity. For their part, the cappy welcome these visits as minor blessings from the Asura and happily allow these creatures to come and go as they please. Cappy can learn to use their natural affinity for animals to communicate with and to some extent direct animals’ behavior, though they avoid doing so if it will cause the animals to come to harm. If threatened, a cappy often calls upon nearby animals to distract and harass their enemies, allowing them to escape or otherwise avoid danger.A cappy community’s response to aggression is consistent with their members’ earnest and peaceful disposition; they far prefer flight to fight and usually try to withdraw rather than cause harm. Though when circumstance forces the issue, a cappy takes up arms as readily as any - but usually only long enough to give them and their comrades a chance to flee. Cappy martial artists are even renowned across Tooj for specializing in techniques that misdirect or delay foes rather than cause injury. Harming or even killing another creature is seen as a dire taboo by many cappy, with those who commit such acts – even accidentally – often withdrawing from their communities in penance. Due to this philosophy, cappy are rarely found adventuring. When they are, it’s usually as healers or sages with practical views regarding the necessity of their and their companions’ work, or they were raised outside of cappy communities. In rare cases, they might even be pariahs who have turned away from cappy culture at large in the face of a dire threat.Favored Ability Score. Wisdom and Charisma. Increase one by 2 and the other by 1.\nAge. Cappy mature quickly, reaching adulthood in 10 years. They are also relatively short-lived with a lifespan of about 60 years.\nAlignment. Friendly and outgoing, cappy tend toward good alignment, and are usually more concerned with fairness and neutrality when it comes to law versus chaos.\nSize. Cappy average about three and a half feet in height and around 70 pounds in weight. Your size is Small.\nSpeed. You have a walking speed of 30 feet and a swimming speed of 15 feet.\nAnimal Empathy. As an action, you focus on one beast within 30 feet of you. Through gentle murmurs and calm movements, you convey simple ideas to the beast and gain a sense of what the beast most wants in the situation. You might be able to persuade a beast to perform a small favor for you, at your GM’s discretion.\nBeast Whisperer. As an action, you may utter soothing words towards a nearby animal.

Many Splicers delve into the world of adventuring in the hopes of discovering exciting new improvements with which to augment their companions. Your foray into the world of biomancy, whether through wizarding school, working with biosmith artificers, or as the surgical assistant to a mad scientist, has resulted in a singular observation: subjects are much more malleable when they’re psychically bonded to you.3rd-level Splicer feature\nYou can fiddle with the very essence of your companions, crafting minor improvements and modifications. When you choose this paradigm, you gain 3 splicer points. Each time you gain a level in the tamer class, you gain 1 additional splicer point. You can spend these points to modify your companions with the following augments—features and traits that take effect when you next finish a long rest. Splicer points are shared across all your companions. If a companion is ever released, it loses any augments it had and the splicer points are refunded. Augments can be gained only once unless otherwise stated. See the Splicer Augments table on the next page for more details.Surgeon’s Tools. You also gain proficiency with surgeon’s tools (see page 121). You can spend 1 hour removing all augments from one companion with your surgeon’s tools, causing it to lose all the associated effects. You regain all splicer points spent on that companion and can re-allocate those points as you see fit3rd-level Splicer feature\nYou learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Splicer Spells table. Each spell counts as a tamer spell for you, but it doesn’t count against the number of tamer spells you know.7th-level Splicer feature\nYou can upgrade each of your companions with exotic organs and appendages. At the start of a long rest, you can choose one of the following upgrades for each of your companions. At the end of the long rest, the biomantic meld completes, and your companion gains the associated action option. The DC for the saving throw equals your tamer spell save DC.\nCompelling Plumage. Each creature in a 25-foot cone that can see your companion must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by your companion’s dazzling display of colour for the next minute. While charmed in this way, the creature is incapacitated and has a speed of 0 feet. The effect ends for an affected creature if it takes any damage, if someone else uses an action to shake the creature out of its stupor, if it no longer has line of sight to the companion, or is ever more than 25 feet away from the companion.\nPhosphoburst. Each other creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centred on your companion must make a Constitution saving throw against the dizzying burst of light your companion emits. On a failure, a creature takes 2d10 radiant damage and is blinded until the end of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t blinded.\nPoison Web. Your companion launches an unfurling web of sticky silk in a 20-foot cube originating from it. All surfaces in the area become lined with webbing for the next minute. Each creature that touches one of these surfaces for the first time on its turn or starts its turn doing so must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or become restrained for the duration, or until it breaks free. A creature restrained by the webs takes 2d4 poison damage when it becomes restrained and at the start of each of its turns. A creature can use its action to make a Strength check against your tamer spell save DC, freeing itself or another creature restrained by this web on a success.\nSirenshriek. Each other creature in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on your companion must make an Intelligence saving throw as your companion lets forth a brain-curdling mental shriek. On a failure, a creature takes 3d8 psychic damage and, if it is concentrating on a spell, loses its concentration. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and makes saving throws to maintain its concentration as normal.\nOnce a companion uses one of these actions, it can’t do so again until it finishes a short or long rest. Starting at 18th level, a companion can use this action twice before a rest.10th-level Splicer feature\nYou augment your companions with a highly adaptive mutagen, allowing them to gain the strengths of foes they defeat and confer it to your other companions through a synchronous quantum biomantic link. As an action, you can command your companion to consume the corpse of a non-swarm creature that has been dead for less than 1 minute. Choose one of the consumed creature’s damage resistances, damage immunities, or condition immunities (except immunity to exhaustion). All of your companions gain resistance to one damage type to which the slain creature was resistant or immune, or gain immunity to one condition to which the creature was immune. After you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest. When you use this feature again, your companions lose any benefit they had previously gained from this feature.14th-level Splicer feature\nAs an action, you trigger a hidden, internal switch within your companion, triggering a cascade of rapid mutations that lasts for the next minute, with the following results:\nIt immediately grows to Huge size (if it isn’t already).\nIts weight increases by a factor of 8 per size category increased.\nIt gains temporary hit points equal to ten times your tamer level.\nIts Strength score increases to 22 (if it isn’t already higher).\nIt gains proficiency in the Athletics skill.\nIt sprouts an appendage with which it can make melee weapon attacks with a reach of 5 feet that deal bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage (your choice when you take the action) equal to 3d6 plus its Strength modifier (+6) on a hit.\nIt gains the Multiattack action option: The companion makes three attacks with its appendage. After the minute elapses, your companion falls unconscious for 1d4 hours and gains 2 levels of exhaustion.\nOnce you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.\n“Splicer Augments Table.png” could not be found.The creature can breathe only underwater.The creature can breathe air and water.

Choose a Small or smaller creature with a challenge rating of 1/2 or lower that isn’t a humanoid, giant, or swarm to become your companion. When a creature becomes your companion, it has a maximum number of hit points equal to the average of its Hit Dice, as indicated in its statistics, and it can’t cast spells. Work with your GM to find a companion that suits your campaign world. This companion obeys your commands and is friendly to you and your allies. Vessel. When not summoned, your companion exists inside a magical vessel of your own design, such as a painted animal skull, bejewelled egg, or crystal sphere. While in this vessel, the companion has full cover from all attacks and other effects, is unaffected by area of effects that originate from outside the vessel, and exists in stasis; it doesn’t need to eat, drink, sleep, or breathe, and it is immune to poison and disease, although a poison or disease already in its system is suspended, not neutralised. A companion at 0 hit points is instantly stabilised when it enters its vessel. If a vessel is broken, or a companion is released from its vessel for any other reason, the creature within it ceases to be a tamer’s companion. It acts according to its own wishes and retains any improvements it gained while a companion.Summoning. As an action, you can summon your companion from a vessel, causing it to appear in an unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet of you, or any unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. You can dismiss a companion within 30 feet of you as a bonus action or action, drawing it back into its vessel. To summon or dismiss a companion, you must be holding its vessel in hand. You can only have one companion summoned at a time.Combat. In combat, your companion shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action or action on your turn to command it to take different actions. Those actions can be in its statistics or some other action, bonus action, or object interaction. If you are incapacitated, the companion can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge. Your companion can’t take the Multiattack action until you reach 5th level in this class, even if it would otherwise be able to. Rest. A companion gains the benefits of a long rest when its tamer finishes a long rest; if it has at least 1 hit point, it regains all its hit points when you finish a long rest. Unlike other creatures, a companion can’t spend its own Hit Dice to recover hit points at the end of a short rest. See the Soul Bond feature for details on recovering hit points.Items. Armour, barding, and weapons can be equipped to enhance your companion. A companion can wear or carry any equipment that their size and body shape permits. However, your companion must be proficient with the armour or weapon to make full use of it. If your companion wears armour that it lacks proficiency with, it has disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity. A companion that is not proficient with a weapon type does not add its proficiency bonus to attack rolls made with that weapon typeItem Bonding. Over the course of an hour, you can bond a companion to one object that it can wear or carry that is not any sort of container or storage. When a companion is recalled, all items it is wearing or carrying that it is not bonded to are dropped in the space from which it was recalled. A companion can be bonded to up to 3 items at any one time. Companions can’t attune to magic items, unless they have a specific ability that allows them to do so (e.g. Proto-Attunement, page 238).Companion Barding. You can purchase armour for your companion. Any type of armour can be purchased as barding. The cost and weight is doubled for each size category above Medium, and halved for each size category below Small. In addition, the cost is further doubled if the companion is not humanoid in shape.1st-level Tamer feature\nCompanions make death saving throws, die, and can be revived like any player character. A companion that has been stabilised remains unconscious until it regains hit points, or until you finish a long rest. Companions that are stable and have 0 hit points when you finish a long rest regain half their maximum hit points. You have a pool of healing power equal to five times your tamer level that replenishes when you finish a long rest. Whenever you finish a short rest, you can choose to draw power from that pool, restoring a total number of hit points amongst your companions up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool.1st-level Tamer feature\nAs you gain levels in this class, your companions become more powerful. Your companions use your proficiency bonus instead of their own, potentially increasing their attack, saving throw, and skill modifiers, and their saving throw DCs.Training. Whenever you gain an Ability Score Improvement from gaining a level in the tamer class, you pass on your hardened resolve to all your companions, causing them to gain 1 additional Hit Die. Increase your companion’s hit point maximum by rolling this Hit Die and adding your companion’s Constitution modifier (minimum of 0). Whenever you gain a level beyond 1st in this class, each companion to which you are bonded gains one of the following improvements. The familiars in Chapter 8 have unique improvements that can be taken instead of these.Any newly gained companions receive these additional Hit Dice and improvements as if you had them since your 1st level in tamer.* E.g., a base speed of 30 feet can be increased to 45 feet maximum, a base speed of 25 feet can be increased to 40 feet, and a base speed of 20 feet to 30 feet.\n** Your companions can each benefit from this feature once. When you reach 5th level in this class, your companions can each benefit from this feature twice. When you reach 9th level in this class, your companions can each benefit from this feature three times. This improvement does not affect attacks made with weapons.\n*** Your companion can’t gain proficiency in medium and heavy armour until it has gained proficiency in the prerequisite lighter armour types. For example, to gain proficiency in heavy armour, you must take this improvement 3 times: light, then medium, then heavy. Work with your GM to figure out if and how a creature can wield shields and weapons.*The CR columns in the table: Improvements/Hit Dice Gained on Training***For example, if a 10th level tamer trained a CR 1 creature, that creature would immediately gain 6 improvements (see previous page) and 1 Hit Die. This is indicated by the value ‘6/1’ in the ‘CR 1’ column and the level ‘10’ row.1st-level Tamer feature\nOne way to defeat deadly foes: have deadlier friends. As you explore, you will encounter new creatures which you may wish to make your companions. You can tame a Small or smaller creature of CR ½ or lower, as described below. As you gain levels in this class, the size and challenge rating of creatures you can tame increases, as shown in the Tamer Companion Summary table. Vessel. To tame a companion, you must first prepare a vessel using special inks, gems, or other materials. Preparing the vessel takes 8 hours of work and components with a value in gold pieces equal to at least one hundred times the target creature’s CR.\nVessels and Cost\nAt 4th level, you can capture creatures of CR 1 and below. To capture a CR ½ or CR 1 creature, you need a vessel worth 50 gp or 100 gp, respectively. If you try to use a vessel worth 50 gp to capture a CR 1 creature, the creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw, and the vessel can be recovered. You can always break down the components of an old vessel to craft a new one as part of the vessel preparation process. You can release a companion from a vessel at any point. The vessel remains intact, and can be used to tame a new creature.\nTaming a Creature. As an action, you can throw an empty vessel at a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw against your tamer spell save DC or be trapped within the vessel. A creature automatically succeeds on this saving throw if: It is a humanoid, giant, or swarm.\nIt is larger than your maximum companion size (use a creature’s unaltered size if it is under the influence of a size-changing magical effect, such as enlarge/reduce).\nIt has a higher CR than your maximum companion CR (see the Tamer Companion Summary table).\nIt has a higher CR than the vessel can capture.\nIt has more than half of its hit points.\nIf a creature doesn’t automatically succeed on this saving throw for one of the above reasons, and has either fewer than ten hit points or one-quarter of its hit points, it automatically fails this saving throw. A creature that fails the saving throw is trapped in your vessel and becomes your companion when you next finish a long rest.Lost Traits. When a creature becomes your companion, it loses the following from its stat block:\nThe ability to cast any spells (though it retains its spells known, see Psychic Bond, page 201).\nAny summoning actions or actions that create additional creatures (such as a wraith’s Create Specter action or an ooze’s Split reaction).\nThe Regeneration, Rejuvenation, and Legendary Resistance traits.\nAny effect that restores hit points, unless that effect has a limited number of uses per day.\nAny legendary actions, mythic traits, legendary action options, and mythic action options.\nAny lair actions and regional effects. Abilities and Proficiency\nAs your companions’ ability scores change—often through Companion Improvement Training—their skill modifiers, saving throws, attack modifiers, and saving throw DCs will also change. Working out what ability a creature’s attack or saving throw uses can require a bit of detective work.\nFirst you have to know the creature’s proficiency bonus (PB). Luckily this is quite easy: it all depends on the creature’s CR and players’ PB. A creatures’ base PB is +2 at CR 0-4 and +3 at CR 5-6. To proceed, subtract the creature’s PB from its modifiers/save DCs. For save DCs, subtract an additional 8 from the DC. Finally, match the remaining values to the ability score modifiers.\nLet’s use the CR 4 red dragon wyrmling’s bite attack and breath weapon as an example. It has a PB of +2, a Strength of 19 (+4), a Dexterity of 10 (+0), and a Constitution of 17 (+3). Its bite attack has a +6 modifier, while its breath weapon has a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. Subtracting the PB from these values (and 8 from the DC), we are left with +4 and DC 3. We can deduce that the bite attack uses Strength (the +4 matches the wyrmling’s Strength modifier), and the fire breath uses Constitution (DC 3 matches the wyrmling’s +3 Constitution modifier).\nIf the wyrmling’s tamer is 13th level (with a PB of +5), then the wyrmling’s PB increases from +2 to +5 when it becomes a companion. This results in its attack modifier and save DC increasing to +9 and DC 16, respectively.\n2nd-level Tamer feature\nBy 2nd level, you have learned to harness your mental fortitude to augment the potential of others. You can cast tamer spells. See page 495 for the tamer spell list.At 2nd level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the tamer spell list. You learn additional tamer cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Tamer table.The Tamer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your tamer spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these tamer spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. For example, if you know the 1st-level spell animal friendship and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast animal friendship using either slot. You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the tamer spell list.The Spells Known column of the Tamer table shows when you learn more tamer spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the tamer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the tamer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.When you gain your first level in this class, choose whether you use your knowledge (Intelligence), willpower (Wisdom), or force of personality (Charisma) as your spellcasting ability for your tamer spells. You use this spellcasting ability whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your spellcasting ability modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a tamer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\nSpell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your spellcasting ability modifier Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your spellcasting ability modifier\nYou can use a creature’s vessel as a spellcasting focus for your tamer spells.Some monster features are very powerful, and aren’t designed for use by players. The two most common are recharge actions and gazes. You can help make a companion more balanced by changing these features slightly. It’s advised to approach this on a case-by-case basis, as each feature is different, and some might not require changing.Recharge Abilities.\nSome creatures’ actions have the addendum “Recharge (5-6)”. This means that after a creature uses that action, it can’t use it again until it has recharged. At the start of the creature’s turn, you roll a d6, and if the result is a 5 or higher, the action recharges. No class has recharge abilities, in part because they add a lot of randomness to the game. Instead of using this recharge mechanic, you can simply change any ability with a recharge to one of the following:Perpetually Active Abilities.\nSome traits, like a medusa’s Petrifying Gaze, which is perpetually active and has the power of a 6th level spell, have the potential to become overpowered and repetitive. To balance this, you can add the caveat that “after a creature makes a saving throw against this effect, it is immune to the effect for the next 24 hours”. Work with your GM to find a balanced solution for your game.2nd-level Tamer feature\nWhile your companion is within 100 feet of you and you are holding its vessel, or if you are holding its vessel with it inside, you can use an action to expend one spell slot to restore hit points to your companion equal to your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum 1) plus an additional 2d4 per level of the spell slot expended.2nd-level Tamer feature\nWhile your companion is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, as an action, you can see through your companion’s eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the companion has. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.Spell Swap. While your companion is summoned, is within 100 feet of you, and you hold its vessel, any spells your companion knows are added to your known spells. In addition, when you cast a spell with a range of self or touch, your companion can be the target of that spell.3rd-level Tamer feature\nAs you gain levels in this class, the number of companions and maximum size of companion to which you can become bonded increases. You can be bonded to two, three, four, five, or six creatures at 3rd, 7th, 11th, 15th, and 19th level, respectively. Your companions can be sized Medium at 5th level, Large at 11th level, and Huge at 17th level. If you are already bonded to your maximum number of companions and become bonded to a new companion, you must choose one existing companion to release from its vessel.When you bond with a new companion, the companion gains improvements and Hit Dice based on its CR and your tamer level. See the Tamer Companion Summary table (page 198) for details. 3rd-level Tamer feature\nYou choose the type of Training Paradigm you follow from the list of available paradigms, which are detailed after the class’s description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 10th, and 14th level. At 18th level, the 7th-level feature is improved.4th-level Tamer feature\nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.5th-level Tamer feature\nThrough rigorous training, you can access the innate fury of your companions. When you take a bonus action or action to command your companion, you can command it to use its Multiattack action, if it has one.5th-level Tamer feature\nWhile your companion is within 100 feet of you, you can order it to change its behaviour towards one creature you can see as part of the bonus action or action you use to command it. Choose either the aggressive or cautious behaviours. At the start of each of the target creature’s turns for the next minute, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw versus your tamer spell save DC if it is within 30 feet of your companion and can see your companion. On a failure, it suffers the effects of the associated behaviour until the start of its next turn. On a success, it is unaffected.\nAggressive. The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls it makes against creatures other than your companion.\nCautious. The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against your companion if there is another creature hostile towards the attacker within 5 feet of the attacker.\nAfter you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest. 6th-level Tamer feature\nWhile summoning a companion, your psychic connection is at its closest, allowing you to quickly relay your intent. As part of the action to summon a companion, you can command it to take an action in its stat block or some other action, which it does so on its turn. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your tamer spellcasting ability modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses of this feature when you finish a long rest.6th-level Tamer feature\nYour magical potency is channeled through your companions’ strikes. Your companions’ attacks count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.13th-level Tamer feature\nYou learn how to switch places with your companion in the nick of time. While you and your companion are within 100 feet of each other, you can use a bonus action, or a reaction when you or your companion is the target of an attack by an attacker you can see, to magically switch places with your companion. If performed as a reaction, the creature that appears in the targeted creature’s space becomes the new target of the attack. You have a number of uses of this feature equal to your tamer spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.17th-level Tamer feature\nWhile your companion is within 100 feet of you, you can order it to change its behaviour as part of the bonus action or action you use to command it. Choose either the provoking poise or shrinking violet behaviours.\nProvoking Poise. For the next minute, your companion draws the attention of nearby creatures. While within 15 feet of your companion, any creature that is hostile towards your companion and that can see it has disadvantage on attack rolls it makes against creatures other than your companion.\nShrinking Violet. For the next minute, your companion appears small and unassuming, making little noise. Any creature that is hostile towards your companion has disadvantage on attack rolls against your companion if there is another creature hostile towards the attacker within 15 feet of the attacker.\nAfter you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.20th-level Tamer feature\nIn times of great need, a tamer can summon many of its companions simultaneously. As an action, you can summon additional companions which remain summoned for 1 minute. You can have a maximum of three companions summoned simultaneously as a result of using this feature.As an action on subsequent turns, you can issue mental commands to all your companions at once, allowing them to take an action in their stat block or some other action. You choose the order in which your companions act each round. After the minute elapses, all your companions bar one (which you choose) return to their vessels and a wave of lethargy sweeps over you; you can’t move or take actions until the end of your next turn. Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"The Tamer","level":1,"id":"The_Tamer_0"},{"heading":"Class Features","level":1,"id":"Class_Features_0"},{"heading":"Hit Points","level":2,"id":"Hit_Points_0"},{"heading":"Proficiencies","level":2,"id":"Proficiencies_0"},{"heading":"Equipment","level":2,"id":"Equipment_0"},{"heading":"Pocket Familiar","level":2,"id":"Pocket_Familiar_0"},{"heading":"Soul Bond","level":2,"id":"Soul_Bond_0"},{"heading":"Monster Trainer","level":2,"id":"Monster_Trainer_0"},{"heading":"Tame Creature","level":2,"id":"Tame_Creature_0"},{"heading":"Spellcasting","level":2,"id":"Spellcasting_0"},{"heading":"Cantrips","level":3,"id":"Cantrips_0"},{"heading":"Spell Slots","level":3,"id":"Spell_Slots_0"},{"heading":"Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher","level":3,"id":"Spells_Known_of_1st_Level_and_Higher_0"},{"heading":"Spellcasting Ability","level":3,"id":"Spellcasting_Ability_0"},{"heading":"Spellcasting Focus","level":3,"id":"Spellcasting_Focus_0"},{"heading":"Powerful Companion Abilities","level":3,"id":"Powerful_Companion_Abilities_0"},{"heading":"Bolster","level":2,"id":"Bolster_0"},{"heading":"Psychic Bond","level":2,"id":"Psychic_Bond_0"},{"heading":"Pocket Family","level":2,"id":"Pocket_Family_0"},{"heading":"Training Paradigm","level":2,"id":"Training_Paradigm_0"},{"heading":"Ability Score Improvement","level":2,"id":"Ability_Score_Improvement_0"},{"heading":"Multiattack","level":2,"id":"Multiattack_0"},{"heading":"Malleable Presence","level":2,"id":"Malleable_Presence_0"},{"heading":"Alpha Strike","level":2,"id":"Alpha_Strike_0"},{"heading":"Wilful Blows","level":2,"id":"Wilful_Blows_0"},{"heading":"Switcheroo","level":2,"id":"Switcheroo_0"},{"heading":"Magnificent Presence","level":2,"id":"Magnificent_Presence_0"},{"heading":"Summon the Horde","level":2,"id":"Summon_the_Horde_0"}],"links":[],"author":"Rasmus","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/01_pcs/tamer-folder/tamer-class-features.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1732519515625,"modifiedTime":1732472681957,"sourceSize":33151,"sourcePath":"01_PCs/Tamer-Folder/Tamer Class Features.md","exportPath":"01_pcs/tamer-folder/tamer-class-features.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":163,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"02_journal/other-campaigns/the-adventures-of-a-party-of-peculiar-personalities/session-01-2024-04-06.html":{"title":"Session 01 - 2024-04-06","icon":"","description":"Rex och Mook kommer in i Lavender n Capers och hejjar på Harry. Han berättar att vi ska på ett nytt uppdrag snart. Dock inte själva utan vi ska ha sällskap. Han pekar på ett bord nere i hörnet av lokalen och där sitter nån filur. Vi går bort till bordet och hälsar. Vi känner igen filuren som en Hobgoblin. Vi introducerar oss och han oxå som Zorg. ”Så vi ska vara kollegor?” säger han. ”Ja, det verkar så”.\nSen går Zorg iväg till baren, köper en öl och stannar kvar där.\nKort därefter kommer en Tortle i korridoren. Han kommer också till slut och sätter sig hos oss efter att han pratat med Harry. Vi introducerar varandra och vi sitter sen och chillar vid bordet. Dörren utifrån slås upp och en liten filur kommer springandes fort och gömmer sig hos oss. Den säger till oss att ”Berätta inte att jag är här”. Kort efter slås dörren upp igen och två vakter kommer in och frågar efter en väldigt liten pojke. Jag frågar dem vad han kan ha gjort o de säger att han stulit och därmed behöver de ta honom. Vi hjälper till att gömma ungen och till slut drar vakterna.\nHarry kommer fram. Då säger ungen att ”jag gör vad som helst!”, och Harry tar det till orda och tar sedan med han iväg och pratar. Sen kommer de tillbaks. Harry berättar att Gideon tydligen tycker att ungen kan vara användbar för oss. Jag säger emot en del för det känns orimligt att vi ska försöka få med den ungen. Men Harry säger att Gideon insisterade att han kan vara användbar för oss.Vi ska till Southcliff och ska prata med deras alderman Eithelhere Yearsley. Det har försvunnit folk därifrån. De vill ha hjälp med att lösa problemet. Vi börjar dra iväg strax efter. Och rör oss effektivt mot Southcliff på Aarid Province. Nätterna går bra, vi blir inte avbrutna nån gång. Vår kära Tortle Jåp sover i sitt skal, Zorg lägger sig sist men vaknar alltid i en buske, jag i ett träd och Mook nedanför samma träd. Och sen ungen, Frans, gömmer sig där det finns utrymme t.ex. ett större ihåligt träd liggandes på marken.Jag får reda på att Frans kommer från Seers Haven som ligger nära omkring där vi är nu. Han vet inte varför han skakar, han har bara alltid gjort det. Han tycker väldigt mycket om att äta mat. Känns som han kanske har svultit lite. Vi vet fortfarande inte vad han har stulit.Vi går och kommer till ett vägskäl, där Jåp pekar vilket håll vi borde gå. Vi kommer till entren av en by och ser en bonde en bit bort. Jag och Mook går till bonden och får veta att det är Soutcliff, och för att komma till aldermannen ska vi gå in mot byn ta första höger, gå över en bro och då kan man se en större byggnad. Vi går inåt och går över en bro men det verkar vara fel. Vi ser en bit bort längs med floden som bron går över så finns en till bro som har ett stort hus nära sig. Vi går tillbaks och mot den bron.\nDå ser vi efter en kort stund en taverna på vägen. Och då säger Zorg att han VÄLDIGT gärna vill gå till tavernan. Vi hinner inte diskutera det alls utan han bara börjar gå.\nVi går ditåt också och möter Zorg i dörrn. Han letar efter en toalett. Så han går ut och går o bajsar som han kände var nödvändigt nu.Plötsligt hör vi en klocka och folk som ropar ”Det brinner!”. Vi ser mörk, svart rök stiga från ett hus en kort bit bort, bakom några andra hus vi har nära. Zorg vänder på foten och går mot elden. Vi andra tvekar lite. Frans går ganska kvickt efter och sen går även vi tre med.\nZorg släcker elden med någon ismagi och kommer sen raskt tillbaks till oss och vi går mot det stora huset. Vi går fram och går in. Där möts vi av en väldigt inredd lokal. Insidan matchar inte alls utsidan.\nMook går o rycker i ett gäng dörrar i närheten men ingen av de verkar leda rätt, nån av dem går till en korridor. Jåp ropar på oss sen att vi ska nog gå rakt fram. Vi går det och går igenom ett par dörrar och där möter vi någon vid ett skrivbord. En gammal man sitter och arbetar.\nVi går fram och frågar om det är Eithelhere Yearsley, vilket det är! Han känner igen oss på våra emblem och vi börjar prata om jobbet.Det är 3 stycken jägare som försvunnit i skogen som finns västerut. De har inte hittat varken kroppar eller spår efter dem. Dessutom har många i stan blivit sjuka och alla börjar prata om liknande saker. De pratar om en grotta i skogen och de har då skickat iväg jägare att leta efter grottan. Men det har gått flera veckor sen dess och ingen har sett spåret av dem efter det.Vi ber om att bli ledda till någon av de sjuka så vi kan prata med dem lite o försöka lista ut lite mer information. Vi leds till typ ett sjukhus och kommer till Darlene som verkar vara läkare eller sjuksköterska. Det visar sig att det är svårt o prata med de sjuka för att de är medvetslösa och har varit det ett bra tag. Det är ibland nu när det är medvetslösa som de har pratat. Mycket osammanhängande och konstigt. Men en sak är gemensamt, alla pratar om en grotta i skogen.Jåp går fram till en av dem och slänger Detect Thoughts på patienten. Jåp ser mycket bilder från patientens minne. Han verkar efter detta veta ungefär var han har befunnit sig när han vart nära grottan.Vi drar utåt och Zorg frågar åldermannen som ännu inte hunnit ut, fortsatt om den anlagda elden. Åldermannen säger att han inte hunnit kolla nåt om det än.Vi går ut, över åkern och mot skogen. Jåp pekar i en riktning in i skogen vi ska söka oss mot och vi börjar gå.\nEn bit in tröttnar Mook och ber mig kolla ovanför träden, så han kastar upp mig och jag kollar omkring men ser inget speciellt. Sen stannar jag vid trädtopparna och rör mig där uppe efter mina kumpaner. Ett tag senare failar jag ett hopp och faller ner, tur va lyckas jag bromsa mig lite emot ett träd. Vi ett tag senare hör något prasslande i en buske. Mook kastar in mig och jag försöker leta upp vad det är. Den flyr och Zorg slänger nån spell och plötsligt är den tillbaks hos mig. Jag grapplar den och hör kort efter att Frans ropar ”stopp, låt den va!”. Frans spelar på sin flöjt och råttan verkar följa melodin rytmiskt.\nJag tar med den ut i mina händer och frågar vad han menar. Frågar Frans om det är hans råtta. Han svarar ja. Jag kastar ner den vid hans fötter och vi går vidare. Råttan håller sig rätt nära oss men på ett kort avstånd ändå. När vi går vidare hör vi flertalet gånger till något som prasslar i buskarna och det är än fler råttor.\nFrans fortsätter spela på flöjten under hela tiden och ger sedan ett kommando till dem, ”leta upp grottan”. Plötsligt börjar de springa mot nån form av mål. Vi alla hänger efter. De leder oss vidare in i skogen och till slut verkar de hittat någon grotta. Vi stannar strax utanför medan Zorg ville använda nån magi inför. Väl färdig funderar han lite och sen drar vi inåt.\nDet är inte en superstor grottgång, både Mook och Zorg behöver huka sig lite.En bit in så känner vi att det är väldigt ljust i andra änden av grottgången. Mook släcker facklan då vi ändå har ljus. Vi går och när vi kommer till där det ljusa så blir grottan ”större” eller bredare, och kort därefter är vi ute igen.\nMycket fallna löv och annat som är gula, orange och röd. Alla färger på allt här känns översaturerade, väldigt starka färger. Träden här är annorlunda mot de som var på andra sidan grottgången. Det finns en stig som går nånstans och som leder oss till en liten bro över en flod. Jåp säger att söderut borde vi se havet nu men det är bara kullar. Det borde inte vara kullar där. De tror att vi kanske är i Feywilds. En del grejer tyder ändå på det.\nVi funderade lite på om vi skulle vända, då Feywilds är rätt farligt. Men vi kommer fram till att vi ska köra på. Råttorna kunde inte hjälpa oss här. Vi börjar bara gå längsmed stigen vi ser här.\nEtt tag senare ser det ut som att det finns civilisation en bra bit bort, som stigen verkar leda till. Vi kommer till ett träd som står i mitten av stigen. När vi kommer närmare står det plötsligt en alv med pil laddad i sin båge och ropar till oss på Alviska; ”Hail travelers. Why are you here?”Jåp verkar kunna Alviska, men ingen annan av oss kan. Så han pratar åt oss. Efter lite dialog så börjar alven prata på Common. Vi berättar att vi söker tre jägare som försvunnit för ett par veckor sedan när det kom en sjukdom till byn på andra sidan här.\nHan svarar på det att de har 3 jägare, 2 människor och 1 halv-alv hos sig som alla har insjuknat. Han bjuder in oss till deras by så vi ska få träffa jägarna. Han säger att de antagligen klarar sig bättre här då de har bra läkare. Han har inte full koll på sjukdomen men hans läkare i byn tror han kan ha bättre koll. <a data-href=\"Quellendien\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Quellendien</a> heter han som mötte ossVi är i The Forest of Everautumn och vi är nu på väg till deras by.

Vi kommer närmare men ser bara fler träd, skog. Inget annat. Dock är träden betydligt större här än där vi mötte alverna. Vi inser att uppåt, uppe i träden ser vi en by. Hus, plattformar och broar. Vi kommer till ett träd och han som lett oss dit knackar på det och ner kommer en repstege. Vi alla klättrar upp och leds sen vidare mot en byggnad och väl inne kommer vi strax till nåt rum med 4 sängar där 3 är ockuperade. Och det verkar vara de tre som vi letar efter som ligger i dessa sänger. Han som mötte upp och ledde oss till byn utbyter några ord med en dam som verkar arbeta här och sen drar han iväg.\nHon pratar lite med oss. De har haft de tre hos sig ett par veckor men det har inte blivit friska. De tror att det kanske har med något mer än bara en sjukdom att göra. Hon nämner något om en mörk dimma som funnits i närheten av dem. De vet även ett område som är väldigt mörkt och aldrig blir ljust och de tror kanske det är en koppling till dimman. Mook tröttnar lite och vi känner att om det inte är något problem att plocka upp dem eller ta på dem så Mook tar alla tre och slänger upp på sin axel. Vi frågar lite om det där mörka området men de verkar inte ha så bra koll på det än. Vi erbjuder oss att hjälpa, mot betalning. Men hon svarar att de har inget direkt behov av det nu.\nEfter en stund kommer <a data-href=\"Quellendien\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Quellendien</a> in igen och tittar lite snett på oss medan vi går ut. Säger samma sak till honom, att vi kan tänkte oss kolla på det mot betalning. Han lyfter på ögonbrynen bara och låter oss gå. När vi går iväg så hör vi att <a data-href=\"Quellendien\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Quellendien</a> nämner något om att ”vår spejare har kommit tillbaka”.<br>Vi klättrar ner från byn och börjar gå sakta iväg mot grottan. Dock håller solen på att gå ner så vi funderar på om vi ska pausa eller fortsätta gå. Jåp höftar att det kan ta 11 timmar att komma tillbaks till <a data-href=\"Southcliff\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Southcliff</a>. Vi diskuterar en del och till slut kommer vi fram till att vi får chilla. Jåp orkar inte gå hela vägen hem då vi kommer behöva gå hela natten. Så vi går tillbaks till alverna.<br>\nVi kommer till träden och där träffar vi <a data-href=\"Quellendien\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Quellendien</a> igen. Han hjälper oss upp, vi lämnar de sjuka i sina sängar igen och ja frågar om vad deras spejare hade hittat. Han svarar att det är trevligare att ta berättelser över en måltid. Vi leds iväg och till slut kommer vi till ett lite större hus, ser ut att kanske vara tvåvåningshus. Verkar vara nån taverna ish.Vi sätter oss där han pekar och efter en stund kommer han tillbaks o säger att de nyss bjudit på mat men de fixar upp nytt till oss. De kan eventuellt ha ett jobb för oss imorn och tackar vi ja så kommer vi få boende och mat osv gratis. Han har inte så mycket information än men tydligen så snackar ”rådet” om hur de ska gå tillväga med det mörka området och spanarna som kommit tillbaks. De ska komma o hämta oss imornbitti. Tills dess får vi äta o sova i deras taverna. Vi chillar där ett tag och sen går vi o lägger oss.<br><a data-href=\"Quellendien\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Quellendien</a> kommer till oss medan vi äter frukost. I mitten av det mörka verkar det finnas en herrgård. Nån byggnad i sten, kanske något som snarare finns i vår värld. Zorg frågar om betalning och vi diskuterar lite kring det. De är villiga att erbjuda oss ädelstenar till ett värde av ungefär 400gp. Zorg tycker det känns lite för lite och önskar 600gp. Lite diskussion senare så drar <a data-href=\"Quellendien\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Quellendien</a> iväg och ska kolla om han kan höja betalningen. Ett tag senare kommer han igen och säger att de godkänner 600gp. Då säger vi att vi accepterar. Men vi vill veta lite mer om vad uppdraget faktiskt kräver, vad vill de att vi ska göra.\nDe önskar att vi tar oss dit, undersöker stället lite och försöker hitta samt fixa vad det är som orsakar mörkret.<br>\nVi ber om lite rations för den extra resan och sen drar vi. <a data-href=\"Quellendien\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Quellendien</a> leder oss ut och pekar i vilken riktning vi ska gå.\nVi börjar gå i fast-travel pace så vi kanske sparar in en hel dag totalt sett. Det var svårt att gå i fast pace åt just det hållet pga mycket sly o annat i vägen så vi går mer västerut till att börja med. När vi gått ett tag så börjar vi se en del stenblock som verkar likna gamla ruiner av byggnader. Vi går till en sån byggnad och på entrésidan finns det nån form av väg som typ går mot dit vi är på väg.\nNär vi ska ta oss till vägen så börjar min svans plötsligt att fatta eld. Jag tar hjälp av Mook att släcka elden o sen letar vi en stund efter något som kan ha fattat elden. Vi hittar inget, så vi går vidare.Ett tag senare på vägen börjar vi se något typ blått sken. Ser nästan ut som rök. Vi går vidare och kommer längre in i dimman. Efter ett tag i den faller Mook ner på backen plötsligt. Kort därefter börjar mina ögon bli väldigt tunga och jag däckar. Samma sak sker för Frans och till sist Zorg.<br>\nJag drömmer. Se <a data-href=\"Session 02 - Rex dröm\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/02_journal/other-campaigns/the-adventures-of-a-party-of-peculiar-personalities/session-02-rex-dröm.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Session 02 - Rex dröm</a> för hela drömmen.\nEn tavla med en man som släpper ut en Urkin som jag ur en bur. Som är tanig o dan, svulten. Mannen ser ut som en pirat eller skeppare typ. Han har en lång mörkgrå rock med en pirathatt. Har två svärd och han verkar le lite när han släpper ut Urkinen. På axeln har filuren ett emblem med tre rökstrimlor som lyfts upp från en eld med glödande kol och en bakgrund med en stigande sol. Vi alla vaknar upp och vi känner oss väldigt utvilade. Vi diskuterar lite och alla verkar ha drömt något. Och alla såg också den mannen jag drömde om.\nVi börjar att gå vidare.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#session"],"headers":[{"heading":"Session Summary","level":2,"id":"Session_Summary_0"},{"heading":"Recap of last session","level":2,"id":"Recap_of_last_session_0"},{"heading":"Log","level":2,"id":"Log_0"}],"links":[".html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html","02_journal/other-campaigns/the-adventures-of-a-party-of-peculiar-personalities/session-02-rex-dröm.html"],"author":"Rasmus","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/02_journal/other-campaigns/the-adventures-of-a-party-of-peculiar-personalities/session-02-2024-04-18.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1730964969230,"modifiedTime":1736887558318,"sourceSize":5928,"sourcePath":"02_Journal/Other campaigns/The Adventures of a Party of Peculiar Personalities/Session 02 - 2024-04-18.md","exportPath":"02_journal/other-campaigns/the-adventures-of-a-party-of-peculiar-personalities/session-02-2024-04-18.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":168,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"02_journal/other-campaigns/the-adventures-of-a-party-of-peculiar-personalities/session-02-rex-dröm.html":{"title":"Session 02 - Rex dröm","icon":"","description":"As your eyes open you are in a cold, stone room, strapped down on a bench. Memories of a horrible past floods your mind. Taken against your will. Your mother, screaming. This room, strapped down, unable to move. Pain, immense, mind breaking pain. Change, growing muscles, breaking skin, growing bones, different teeth. A slaughtered village.Your heart starts to race and your breathing becomes short as you struggle to free yourself from your restraints with fear welling up inside you. Not here! Not again! You can’t go through that again!No matter how hard you try, the restraints are not budging. You realise you have no idea how long you have been here as the fear subsides somewhat and you stop struggling. Anxious, your eyes dart around the room looking for something to help you. The room is sparsely furnished. Behind you, to your right, stands a chair and a desk in the corner, a bookshelf covering the wall behind the desk. By the wall to your left stands a workbench. It is littered with knives, vials, syringes, scissors and other tools. Some are clean but some have some stains of something brownish red on them. In front of you is a closed wooden door. To its right is a small table with the only light source in the room, a small wax candle.On the wall above the table is something that does not fit in with the rest of the room. A painting in a decorated wooden frame. The frame looks like it is carved with a motif of many different flowers. It looks simple yet fancy. But what really catches your attention is the painting. It depicts a man kneeling in front of an open cage. It looks like the man has just unlocked the cage and is gently trying to help a creature out of it. A small creature with white and grey and black fur, a fluffy tail and ears like, well, your own. A creature you recognize. An Urkin. A small, skinny, starved Urkin who almost looks too weak to stand The man is wearing a long dark grey coat and on his head is one of those three pointed hats people at sea might wear. In his belt hangs two swords and you think you can see the hint of a kind smile as the man looks at the weak Urkin he is trying to help. On his shoulder you see an emblem depicting three lines of smoke rising from a campfire with glowing coals on a background of a rising sun.Your vision starts to fade and slowly everything goes dark.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"Rasmus","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/02_journal/other-campaigns/the-adventures-of-a-party-of-peculiar-personalities/session-02-rex-dröm.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1730964968342,"modifiedTime":1736887558323,"sourceSize":2359,"sourcePath":"02_Journal/Other campaigns/The Adventures of a Party of Peculiar Personalities/Session 02 - Rex dröm.md","exportPath":"02_journal/other-campaigns/the-adventures-of-a-party-of-peculiar-personalities/session-02-rex-dröm.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":169,"backlinks":["02_journal/other-campaigns/the-adventures-of-a-party-of-peculiar-personalities/session-02-2024-04-18.html"],"type":"markdown"},"02_journal/other-campaigns/the-adventures-of-a-party-of-peculiar-personalities/session-03-2024-05-05.html":{"title":"Session 03 - 2024-05-05","icon":"","description":"![[]]När vi vaknade började vi gå vidare och ser en stor mängd fjädrar som ligger utspridda runtomkring. De ligger framförallt inuti dimman. Jåp snor till sig en fjäder mha. Magehand.\nDen är rätt stor och är massa nyanser av blått.Vi går vidare senare. Efter ett gäng timmar börjar det bli mörkare, trots att det fortfarande är dag. Det börjar saknas löv på träden och allt i omgivningen känns väldigt mörkt och dött typ. Efter vi gått ett par timmar till i den mörkare, korrupta skogen ser vi ett hustak vid en kulle en liten bit västerut. Vi kommer dock tyvärr till vägen vi följt efter vi gått över kullen. Huset är en bra bit längre bort och vi följer sedan vägen fortsatt mot huset. Hela trädgården är helt övervuxen. Det finns en rätt stor fontän på vägen till huset. En ganska stor trappa upp till dörrarna. Vi går in igenom första dörren och där verkar vara en entré och det börjar även bli väldigt mörkt. Vi tänder nån fackla och sen sparkar Mook upp nästa dörr och vi går in i huset. Det finns trappor rakt fram som på var sin sida går upp en våning till bland annat en balkong. Det är fortsatt rätt mörkt. Finns statyer under trapporna. Finns en del dekorationer runtomkring också.Vi går vänster från entrén och kommer till 3 dörrar. Mook sparkar upp ena dörren och där är en korridor som leder vidare, så vi vänder på klacken och tar nästa dörr. Där verkar vara ett förvaringsrum. Massa random bröte i tunnorna som vi hittar där. Det verkar också tråkigt så vi tar den tredje dörren. Verkar vara nått kapprum med lite hattar och annat. Vi blir lite osäkra, men jag går fort in till korridoren och rycker upp första dörren som jag kommer till och där inne är ett väldigt stort rum. Mycket inredning och annat där inne och det finns också en scen i andra änden av rummet.\nMook bankar sönder en glasmonter som hade en ring i sig. I den fanns Spell storing ring (dock vet vi inte att det är den ringen). Jag får den av Mook och trär på den på två av mina fingrar på vänster hand.\nJag drar sen iväg för att kolla nästa rum och Mook hänger med. Zorg och Frans drar in bakom scenen och kikar. När jag och Mook kommer in i rummet jämte så finns där också en liten scen med en flygel i. Vi ser två skelett liggandes vid sidan av i rummet. Vi lootar dem och hittar ett halsband på dem var. De är liknande men har olika emblem på. En har en örn och den andra en utter.\nVi drar igenom dörren och där ett lite annat rum. Nåt vardagsrum typ. Finns en spiraltrappa i hörnet och jämte den en dörr. Jag klättrar upp på Mook igen och vi rusar in igenom dörren som finns vid trappan. Den gick tydligen till biblioteket som de andra redan sett sedan tidigare.Jåp går fram till mitten av biblioteket och läser nån note som låg där.\nJag klättrar upp till balkongen ovanför biblioteket men fann där inget och klättrar ner igen. Vi kollar runt och kommer till korridoren som Zorg och Frans håller på och eldar i. Den dörren verkar leda ut till baksidan av mansionen, så vi tänker att vi avvaktar med den. Mook påminner om trappan som var i rummet innan lilla scenen med flygeln. Jag drar dit och går upp för trappan. En korridor där med ett gäng dörrar. Den första till vänster gick till övervåningen på biblioteket. Den till höger verkar vara nått sovrum som inte hade nåt intressant. Vidare i korridoren sen är det mängder av rubbel som täcker ingången till två olika dörrar. Kommer inte förbi in i rummet men tar nästa dörr och där var också ett sovrum med ett skelett som höll i ett halsband. Det liknade också de andra halsbanden men med en grävling på.\nFinns ett par tavlor i de olika rummen och i detta så finns det en familj med en liten flicka. Flickan har ett halsband med en örn på. Vi känner oss nöjda på denna delen av huset nu så går tillbaks mot huvudentrén och in i nästa godtyckliga dörr. Där var nån stor matsal + 2 toasalar. Kom sedan till ett kök och vidare in till en mindre matrum och till sist vidare till en korridor. Svänger vi direkt höger i korridoren kommer vi till entrén. Hittar ett till skelett som hade ett guldhalsband på sig med en björn på.\nVi drar sedan upp för trapporna. Där finns fönster som blickar ner för den stora matsalen vi var i tidigare.\nVi går dörren till vänster och kommer till slut till samma övervåning som jag var på tidigare. Vi går ut och in i första dörren åt vänster innan fönstrena och där var bara 3 stycken sovrum. Sen nästa efter fönstrena var också sovrum.\nVi försöker komma på vart vi inte varit. Vi går till högra korridoren jämte entrén och hittar där typ en sjukstuga. Zorg hittar två skelett med varsitt guldhalsband. En med häst och en med hjort på.Jag går till sista dörren i korridoren. Där fanns krukor med döda växter och en dörr som leder till sjukstugan jämte. Vi går sedan och möter upp Jåp som under tiden chillat i biblioteket och läst. Han berättar om lappen han läst och det verkar vara slitet ut ur nån dagbok typ.\nVi kommer på sen att det fanns ett blockerat rum på övervåningen. Vi drar dit och Mook börjar gräva undan lite, tillräckligt så jag kan klättra igenom. Väl inne ser jag ett par tavlor till. 3 stycken tavlor med varsin alv på. Från vänster till höger;\nYngre alvman med björn halsband, Pamaris Aspenvale\nYngre alvtjej med häst halsband, Jodi Aspenvale\nÄnnu yngre alvtjej med utter halsband, Gilreith Aspenvale\nDet står nånting längst ner på alla tavlor som jag inte kan läsa. Jag skär bort ena och och skickar ut genom rubblet. Det verkar vara namn på filurerna som på tavlorna. Finns en tavla vid sidan med ett par och en bebis.\nMan med uggla, Lord Miraden Aspenvale\nKvinna med hjort, Lady Shamala Aspenvale\nSen är vi nöjda här inne, vi har vart överallt. Vi går ut genom elddörren.\nOch hittar fler dörrar. Den direkt till höger verkar gå till ett förråd. Där inne finns en trappa NEDÅT och ett skelett till som ligger nära trappen. Fanns en fin lykta jämte skelettet. Zorg går in i den andra dörrarna och hittar också en kropp + ett halsband med en uggla på.Inne i förrådet hänger också en väska som verkar vara en bag of holding. Zorg tar den och vänder upp-och-ner på. Ut kommer en lykta som lyser med en eld i och en del pulver av något slag.\nSedan går vi ner för trappan. Väl nere i rummet ser vi 3 riddarstatyer. På andra sidan rummet finns en dörr.\nJag kollar lite på statyerna och ser att det finns en urgröpning för ett halsband i vardera staty.En av statyerna håller ut handen och vi ger den lyktan vi hittade nyss och då tar statyn tag i den.\nJag sätter på ett halsband på den som verkar ska ha halsband, börjar med björn men inget händer. Provar grävling och då fastnar den. Vi funderar sen vad som kan sitta på handen på statyn som har handflatan öppen uppåt. Det är en liten urgropning med något som sticker upp i mitten. Jåp funderar på att det kanske kan vara ett fickur eller klocka av något slag.\nNågra av oss springer runt och letar efter något fickur. Jag letar i det blockerade rummet på övervåningen men hittar inget. Zorg kollar förrådet och Mook letar också. Jag hör han ropa efter en stund och då springer jag ner igen. Väl nere hittar jag dem och Mook har hittat en guldig klocka. Vi lägger ner den i handen och tydligt börjar det bullra en del och till slut klickar det till i dörren. Vi öppnar den och går igenom. Vi kommer in och där är en bred korridor av något slag och vi ser en trappa på andra sidan. Verkar vara någon rättssal typ. Mycket publik kan sitta runtomkring och nån domare av något slag kanske brukar sitta i andra änden mot där vi kom in. Vi hittar inte direkt något intressant eller något av intresse i detta rummet. Ett par skelett typ av vad som verkar vara äventyrare.Jåp tar fram och kollar på en bok som han fick av Mook tidigare. Mook hittade den på samma ställe som han hittade fickuret. Det verkar vara en lite lurig bok, kanske är någon spell på första sidan. Resten av boken är tom.\nVi kompromissar lite och Jåp ska få läsa det som står.\nHan ställer sig i mitten av rummet och vi andra ställer oss en bit bort. Jåp läser, inget händer. Jåp efter han läst känner att det kanske saknar något i slutet. Gissningsvis givet pappret han hittat tidigare och tror att det kanske ska vara ett namn man stoppar in där som sista ord. Vi provar igen men halvvägs igen om börjar vi höra skittering av något slag, typ massa insektsben som rör sig.\nVi blir lite oroliga så börjar gå utåt. Men vi hinner knappt vända oss innan vi alla hör;\n”Who are you, that come here to my lair”\nJag svarar, vem är du?\n”Who are we? We are we. We are one, but we are many. We are everywhere and we are hungry”\nKort efter ser vi en skepnad som reser sig från bakom borden. Nån typ feminin filur med långt hår. Vi ser bara en siluett.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#session"],"headers":[{"heading":"Session Summary","level":2,"id":"Session_Summary_0"},{"heading":"Recap of last session","level":2,"id":"Recap_of_last_session_0"},{"heading":"Log","level":2,"id":"Log_0"}],"links":[],"author":"Rasmus","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/02_journal/other-campaigns/the-adventures-of-a-party-of-peculiar-personalities/session-03-2024-05-05.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1730964968821,"modifiedTime":1736887558322,"sourceSize":9354,"sourcePath":"02_Journal/Other campaigns/The Adventures of a Party of Peculiar Personalities/Session 03 - 2024-05-05.md","exportPath":"02_journal/other-campaigns/the-adventures-of-a-party-of-peculiar-personalities/session-03-2024-05-05.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":170,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"02_journal/other-campaigns/the-adventures-of-a-party-of-peculiar-personalities/session-04-2024-06-17.html":{"title":"Session 04 - 2024-06-17","icon":"","description":"![[]]Vi ser siluetten av en dam bakom bordet i änden av rummet.

De andra är kvar i källaren. Jåp skickar en Sending till mig och frågar om jag vet vart tanten är, jag svarar att hon är vid huvudentrén, stora rummet, balkongen.Jag springer upp till henne och börjar attackera. Mot första slaget slänger hon upp en sköld av beetles. Andra och tredje slaget missar jag. Hon summonar upp totalt 6 stycken beetle-swarms.\n(6 plattor, det var visst 25 stycken enskilda svärmar). De attackerar mig och av dem fastnar 15 stycken på mig. Jag försöker springa iväg från alla beetles som inte satt sig på mig. Lyckas fly en bit. Men de som satt på mig knockar mig och jag blir downad. Men blir stabilized direkt.De andra kommer till rummet och hittar en hög med beetles som rör sig massa. Mook slår ner en tunna på alla dem och där under låg jag. Jag downar igen och får en fail. Sen gör Zorg en magi för att döda alla beetles och jag tar skada där med, så två fails. Nästa runda börjar och Frans fick heala innan jag rollar death saves och jag blir stable igen.Vi fightas en stund till. Efter ett tag är hon nästan bara en swarm med beetles och hon befinner sig ovanpå Frans. Jag ber Mook att kasta mig, då jag ser att det glimmar. Han kastar och jag lyckas fånga halsbandet. Jag rullar iväg pga farten jag fick. Sen kastar jag halsbandet till Jåp som tittar på det och jag har ihjäl henne. Svärmen faller ihop och ett skelett kommer fram ur intet tillsammans med en röd klänning och lite guld-accessoarer. Jag på plockar upp dem och det råkar vara 100gp som vi delar på 4 (Mook får inget). Sen börjar vi vandra iväg tillbaks. Vi märker fort att det mörka som varit tidigare inte finns kvar, vilket känns rätt bra. Vi har kanske lyckats då.Vi tar en lång rest och sen fortsätter gå. Det börjar bli mörkt och de dröjer ett par timmar till innan vi är framme hos alverna där vi sovit tidigare. Vi sover gott och vaknar sen en stund innan vi märker att en alv står hos oss och frågar hur det gått. Vi säger att vi hitta något odött och vi har haft ihjäl någonting odött o sen blev det fint väder. Vi frågar också om vi kan få mat vilket han sa att de kan bjuda på. Han berättar också att de sjuka personerna vi såg uppe hos dem är friska och gick iväg dagen innan typ.\nFrans ropar medan diskussionen går; ”kan vi få pengarna?”. Alven som stod där ger oss pengarna. Pratar lite till o sen går han och försvinner. Vi går sedan upp och tar oss till där vi åt förra gången. Vi äter. Under tiden vi äter går Frans iväg och sätter eld på en gardin i ett sovrum nånstans. Han kommer sen tillbaks.\nFrans går o pratar med Zorg o berättar att han har satt eld på nåt. Zorg blir lite stissig och säger högt ”Oj vad tiden går det är nog dags att vi går iväg, tack så mycket för maten, hej då” o så börjar vi gå.\nJag, Mook o Jåp klättrar ner. Ropar till Frans och Zorg att vi ska gå nu och Zorg svarar att de är på väg. Vi tre där nere börjar gå. Frans kommer strax nedför stegen. När han väl är nere så faller repstegen ner på marken och vi kan se att Zorg pissar på marken precis där repstegen var. Sen flyter han sakta nedåt mot marken och möter upp oss efter ett tag. Vi går och går och kommer fram till grottan som vi går igenom och kommer till vårt plan. Klockan är rätt sent och det är ett gäng timmar kvar. Men vi går till byn ändå. Jag, Mook och Zorg tar två rum, Jåp ville dra till en gränd och lägga sig i sitt skal. Frans ville dra till ett stall för o sova. På morgonen drar vi till borgmästaren igen för o avsluta uppdraget. Vi kommer till han och han undrar vad som hände, vi berättar väldigt kort och sen visar han vår betalning, 750gp. Vi delar upp det på oss 5, 150gp var. Sen drar vi mot Capers’.\nDet tar ungefär en vecka hem.

Vi ska ta oss till Valv 23 och hjälpa de röda att få tillbaka sakerna som de blå tydligen ska ha stulit. Det visar sig dock att ALLA kobolds är lila??? De vi träffade säger att de är mer röda och det är ju ”tydligt”. Vi tog oss till Gåtrummet och har en tanke på hur man ska lösa den, vi tog oss igenom några fällor och kom till Valv 17 och plockade med oss lite rewards. Sist drog vi till Monstervingen och hittade där att ett av monstrena de har tillfångatagit var en Duergar som vi lyckades övertala att ta med oss så vi kan låta han komma hem senare. Slutligen var vi på väg till gaskammarna och där avslutade vi.\nVi börjar med 500GP var vi får handla grejer med. Vi träffas vid Harry’s bar och väntar på att få vårt uppdrag. Ingen av oss har arbetat på Shimmers tidigare. Där träffar vi tre varandra, jag Patrik, Kaelen och Soloko Loko.Vi lär känna varandra lite medan vi väntar på att få komma till Gideon. Vi får komma in till Gideon till slut. Han berättar att han fått ett brev från tidigare äventyrare. Brevet är skitdåligt skrivet men verkar som att någon ber en ”Redscale” om hjälp för att ”stupid blues rob vault. pay mercenaries good, pronis!!!”Det är ett gäng med kobolds som är röda, och ett annat gäng som är blå.\nDe är mer lila än röda dock, enligt våra mer ordinära ögon. Vi kommer nog oxå se de blå som en hue av lila oxå.Aarid Province, längsmed den södra ingången av the Green Peaks. Vi ska färdas längsmed en å och följa den bäst vi kan och sedan ta en passage i en dal igenom bergskedjan. Alla kobolds i området styrs hårt av en blå drake. Men den bör vara upptagen med annat enligt källor.Det riktiga uppdraget är: Gideon vill veta vad som finns och vad vi tar med från valvet de pratar om i brevet.Vår kärra vi ska med åker samma kväll och den leder oss så långt det går. Vi blir sen ledda av scouten ett bra tag, tills han pekar åt ett håll och säger att det är dit vi ska.På avstånd ser vi ett par stenar som lyfts upp som hattar. Under sitter tre kobolds. En av dem vinkar och vi går fram och möter dem.\nMogul, Krix och Krux.De följer en drake med något knasigt namn. Vi ska ledas nu till en elder som ska berätta mer om varför blå har varit inne i Valv 23. Vi leds in och vi hade aldrig någonsin kunnat hitta rätt utan en guide. Vi går igenom oändliga tunnlar och gångar.\nVi börjar rätt tidigt få höra om något som kallas för Högen. Det är vid en amfiteater typ. I mitten där finns en hög som flertalet Kobolds bara ligger på. Ovanpå Högen finns Kistan och på den sitter en Elder-Kobold. Han är SNORGAMMAL och det syns. Extremt LILA och inget annat. ”ÅÅh, ni är knektarna vi har letat efter. Någon har, NI har, fått tag i vårt kall på hjälp. Ni måste….” Han tar ett steg ner för Högen och han trillar direkt och ruller ner för hela Högen. ”Ni är här för att hjälpa oss ta tillbaka allt som är stulet från valv 23. Och döda slynglarna, de förrädiska blue-scales, som har förrått våran drottning.”Han vet inte vad de har stulit. Men ”magiska saker, vapen och guld o pengar”.Vi ska ta oss till den stora Högen.\n”Men innan vi kan ta oss till stora högen, måste vi ta oss igenom lava-floden. Och innan vi kommer till lava-floden, så måste vi igenom portal-rummet. Och innan vi kommer till portal-rummet, så måste vi gå igenom the artificiary. Och innan detta rummet, så måste vi gå igenom vår shrine till vår gud. Men innan! Måste vi gå igenom gas-tunnlarna. Innan det, finns det tre platser man kan besöka för att komma till gas-tunnlarna. Monster-vingen\nGåtrummet. Om man löser gåtorna blir man belönad med artifakter av oberäknelig makt, precis som det fanns i Valv 23.\nDeras egna valv. Men man dör en valv-död om man öppnar valvet. Redscales har sina grejer i valv 17.Den gamle plockar fram en karaff ur Högen med dricka och tvingar oss att dricka\nDrink of Dragon-TongueVi träffar Pip, som ska gå med oss bort. Han har en breastplate, alltså en riktig armor. Träffar också ett par till som hänger med, omkring ett dussin.Pip är generalen för Redscales. Han har vart med i 17 krig under hans 13 levnadsår. Han säger att Gåtrummet kallas för skräprummet av alla andra än deras Elder.En av koboldsen i partyt nämner att de har en fördel gentemot de blå. De är BÄST på att göra fällor. Samtidigt som han säger det så går kobolden längst fram genom en tripwire och ett spjut av ren metall skjuts från sidan och träffar han i magen. Han flyger in i väggen på andra sidan och tappar sina urnor med olja han bar på.\nNästkommande kobold som bar på en torch tappar den i rädsla och tänder eld på oljan. Stackarn med spjutet i magen börjar nu brinna med.Vi går vidare och kommer fram till skräprummet. Det är fullt med vardagliga grejer. Krukor, tallrikar, hjul från kärror, flaskor, kläder och mycket mer.Pip nämner att det finns inga fällor, förutom pelaren. Om man petar på den så dör man säger han. Soloko går fram och ser att det står text på pedestalen, och där verkar vara gåtan.Kaelen verkar koppla gåtan bättre än oss andra. Han tror att det kan ha med något ont/elakt att göra. Något syndigt beteende typ. Det kanske oxå behöver vara flera objekt, inte bara ett. Han tycker inte heller att objekten kanske är här inne. Det kan ha försvunnit under åren.Vi har en tanke att det kanske har att göra med en bägare som Kaelen hittade och kanske vin som dryck? Vi hittar dock inget vin..Soloko ställer en liten bägare med rom och blod i på pedestalen mha Mage Hand. Direkt efter kommer en fireball som smäller. Min Rakitten flyttar på den så vi inte tar lika mycket skada. Vi går istället nu till deras valv, Valv 17. Det finns tre gångar in, två utöver den vi kommer igenom.\nVi ser att flera fällor där inne har blivit aktiverade sen tidigare. Det finns spår av blod som leder ut genom en av gångarna som vi inte kom ifrån.Vi följer blodet och kommer till en kobold som ligger vid väggen, blodig och dan. Hans käke har lossnat. Soloko helar honom och han vaknar till liv. Efter lite försök till snack så kommer vi fram till att det finns eller har funnits blå folk i valvet.\nVi går dit och öppnar porten och det är en korridor där och i andra änden en till port.Soloko tar ett steg in i valvet och då kommer en pelare på andra sidan upp, med två stora blad som börjar rotera och gunga upp och ner. Den rör sig sedan mellan de två portarna.Vi skickar iväg en Kobold som kryper under den bort mot andra porten. Och typ 15ft in faller stenen han kröp på ner och han faller ner i ett hål.\nVi skickar en ny kobold som tar andra sidan och han gör samma sak men 25ft bort.\nVi skickar en till, som kör zick-zack istället och han kommer fram!Men dörren är för tung. Han behöver fler. Vi skickar två till, båda kommer fram, men en tappar en arm när han missar att fällan kommer och han faller ner död vid dörren. Jag skickar Rakitten till han som dött och slänger Spare the Dying. De lyckas öppna dörren och de hittar en spak på andra sidan dörren som stänger av fällan. Resterande går sedan igenom och vi kommer till Valv 17!Vi hittar följande i Valvet:\nLong sword. Superfin och blank yta. I änden finns en grön kinesisk drake.\nEtt par axelskydd\nEn glaskula med en storm i\nPlatinumtackor\nSoloko tar långsvärdet och försöker svepa med det i luften.\nJag tar axelskydden och stormkulan. Axelskydden (ranger) verkar ge mig bättre syn (darkvision 15ft). Stormkulan känns som att man kan skjuta blixtar med.Vi känner sedan att vi vill dra till monstervingen. Finns chans att vi kan få mer skatter där.Väl där finns det en större mängd tunnor med vad som verkar vara kött och nån vätska, kanske vatten, i. De luktar fruktansvärt illa. Det finns köttkrokar på ena av sidorna oxå.Det finns 4 öppningar utöver den vi kom ifrån. Det är lite djupa morr och gnarls från de 4 öppningarna.\nI mitten av rummet sitter en kobold som vänder sig mot oss när vi kommer.\nDet är Mox. Han ”styr” det här stället. Vi säger att vi skulle vilja släppa iväg djuren för att döda blå. Pip flikar in och håller med. Mox vill inte det. De bor här. Jag tittar in genom de 4 gångarna genom min Rakitten som har 60ft darkvision. I första gången ser jag nåt grönbrunt-ish som en alligator. Den har massa tjocka röda spikar längs med ryggraden. och en ganska lång svans. Den tittar ner i golvet. Den har stenbitar som ligger på golvet. Den ser oxå för stor ut för att överhuvudtaget ta sig ut ur hålet. Jag känner igen det som en Basilisk. Ser man den i ögonen kan den förvandlas till sten. I nästa gång finns en manticore. I tredje hålet en haj\nI fjärde är det en väldigt nergången, ledsen, miserabel, duergar. En grå-dvärg typ. När jag skickade katten till andra gången så blev den skjuten av manticoran. Vi kollar i sista hålet och jag går fram till Duergaren där. Han blev tillfångatagen när han fastnade i en fälla. Jag gav han lite rations och helade hans disease.\nVi lyckas övertala Mox om att vi får ta med honom o ha som monster som ska ha ihjäl de blå sen.\nVi knyter fast honom med ett rep vi har med oss. Knyter så mycket vi kan och försöker sedan övertyga Koboldsen om att det är ett Magiskt rep som klarar hålla fast honom. Vi rollade 2 och 7, o de fick 9 minus 2 så vi klara oss precis. Sen säger Pip att vi ska nu dra oss till gaskammarna och efter det kommer de osäkra och farliga rummen.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#session"],"headers":[{"heading":"Session Summary","level":2,"id":"Session_Summary_0"},{"heading":"Log","level":2,"id":"Log_0"}],"links":[],"author":"Rasmus","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/02_journal/other-campaigns/the-redscales/session-01-2024-11-17-blue-vs-red-kobolds.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1732519515635,"modifiedTime":1736873798731,"sourceSize":10038,"sourcePath":"02_Journal/Other campaigns/The Redscales/Session 01 - 2024-11-17 - Blue vs Red Kobolds.md","exportPath":"02_journal/other-campaigns/the-redscales/session-01-2024-11-17-blue-vs-red-kobolds.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":174,"backlinks":["02_journal/other-campaigns/the-redscales/session-02-2024-11-24-blue-vs-red-kobolds.html"],"type":"markdown"},"02_journal/other-campaigns/the-redscales/session-02-2024-11-24-blue-vs-red-kobolds.html":{"title":"Session 02 - 2024-11-24 - Blue vs Red Kobolds","icon":"","description":"Vi tog oss till the Green Peaks och mötte de röda kobolds Elder, Zigil. Vi ska ta oss till Valv 23 och hjälpa de röda att få tillbaka sakerna som de blå tydligen ska ha stulit. Det visar sig dock att ALLA kobolds är lila??? De vi träffade säger att de är mer röda och det är ju ”tydligt”. Vi tog oss till Gåtrummet och har en tanke på hur man ska lösa den, vi tog oss igenom några fällor och kom till Valv 17 och plockade med oss lite rewards. Sist drog vi till Monstervingen och hittade där att ett av monstrena de har tillfångatagit var en Duergar som vi lyckades övertala att ta med oss så vi kan låta han komma hem senare. Slutligen var vi på väg till gaskammarna och där avslutade vi.\nGrell, Kairs, Xina och Pip.\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Soroko Roko\" data-href=\"Soroko Roko\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/01_pcs/not-my-pcs/soroko-roko.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Soloko Loko</a> upptäckte att det finns en Planar Portal typ 1 Mile bort åt ungefär samma håll vi är på väg.Om ni andas in gasen, gå lite långsammare istället säger Pip. Men den ska inte vara så farlig i övrigt. Den är inte antändbar i alla fall.<br>Vi går framåt och efter en stund går grottan lite neråt och sen uppåt igen. När den börjar gå uppåt börjar alla kobolds att sniffa efter något. <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Soroko Roko\" data-href=\"Soroko Roko\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/01_pcs/not-my-pcs/soroko-roko.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Soloko Loko</a> känner samma sak, nån konstig doft. När vi kommer upp till mer plan mark upptäcker vi mängder av flera tunnlar åt olika håll från flera broar.\nI botten i avgrunden som är nedanför broarna sitter det många svampar med nät-hattar (ihåliga hattar typ). Koboldsen verkar vara på spänn och hålla utkik efter saker.<br>\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Soroko Roko\" data-href=\"Soroko Roko\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/01_pcs/not-my-pcs/soroko-roko.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Soloko Loko</a> frågar Pip om vi ska vara rädda för något. Han svarar “Smygarn”. Det är en varelse som är svår att se. Den ska man akta sig för. Men hur farlig den är “beror på avstånd”.\nDen söker i tunnlarna efter stulna items från valven. <br>Jag tsm med <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"01_PCs/Tamer-Folder/Spells > Primal Scent\" data-href=\"01_PCs/Tamer-Folder/Spells#Primal Scent\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/01_pcs/tamer-folder/spells.html#Primal Scent\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Primal Scent</a> försöker dofta efter något. Rollar bra.\nDet verkar vara så att varelsen luktar inget. Så att den sticker ut bland gasen. Doften känns som den kommer uppifrån.\nVi har bestämt att ta en specifik väg. Vi bestämmer oss för att smyga vidare, då varelsen verkar vara känslig. Det är lite svampar på ena väggen på vägen vi ska gå. Kobolderna håller sig undan och håller andan. Vi försöker göra samma och går långsamt vidare. Efter kort stund börjar vi höra viskningar. Efter en liten stund till ser vi oss omkring och vi märker att något verkar konstigt.\nKobolderna verkar inte tycka om viskningarna och börjar springa. En stund senare springer vi efter men med lite distans från dem. De stannar plötsligt och framför dem ser vi en svamp som växt upp i mitten av vägen, som de inte vågar gå förbi.\nVi upptäcker dock snabbt att vi inte har Kaelen med oss. Han är borta. Pip säger att då får väl ni vända o leta upp honom. Vi tar en Kobold med oss som pant så att de andra inte sticker innan vi kommer tillbaks.Vi rör oss tillbaks och försöker leta efter Kaelen.\nDvärgen kommer med lite smarta tankar. Antingen är detta bara hallucinationer eller så är det en osynlig varelse.<br>\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Soroko Roko\" data-href=\"Soroko Roko\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/01_pcs/not-my-pcs/soroko-roko.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Soloko Loko</a> hoppar in i Border Ethereal Plane men ser inget där. Vi försöker istället att tracka honom. Till slut efter ett tag upptäcker vi Kaelen. Han står själv och snackar ut i luften. Han upptäcker oss men går åt fel håll. Vi kämpar med att försöka få tag i Kaelen men det är svårt.Efter kort stund försöker Kobolden springa iväg. Men vi stoppar honom och sätter honom på Sunsnacker så han kan känna sig mer trygg. I samma sekund som han ska sättas ner så hör vi mer vindar och plötsligt har kobolden ett skärsår över heeela bröstet och dör. <br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Soroko Roko\" data-href=\"Soroko Roko\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/01_pcs/not-my-pcs/soroko-roko.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Soloko Loko</a> försöker känna vad för typ av creature det är och upptäcker att det är en elemental. Dvärgen nämner att det är ju svårt att hantera och göra något åt. Men han ser <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Soroko Roko\" data-href=\"Soroko Roko\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/01_pcs/not-my-pcs/soroko-roko.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Soloko Loko</a>s svärd och frågar om inte vi kan göra något åt den. Jag tar direkt upp blixt-bollen och försöker sniffa mig fram vart den befinner sig och sen riktar jag och försöker använda bollen där det luktades.\nEn stor blixt slår ner där jag pekade. Vinden blir starkare en kort stund och sen dör helt.\nStenar och annat börjar lyftas från marken där vi står och en skepnad manifesterar sig. Lite humanoid-liknande.\nDen säger “Visa respekt i mitt tempel, så är ni förlåtna”. Och sen försvann den. Kort därefter märker vi att Kaelen är tillbaks. Han tittar på oss och går mot oss. Vi diskuterar lite om varför han gått fel väg men han tror han gått rätt. Till slut börjar vi gå tillbaks till där koboldsen förhoppningsvis väntar på oss.<br>Vi kommer dit och där väntar de på oss. De har fixat svampen. Men Pip tittar mot oss och säger “Kan ni hjälpa med en grej? Ta hand om de där två.” säger han och pekar mot två kobolds som inte verkar må helt 100. <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Soroko Roko\" data-href=\"Soroko Roko\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/01_pcs/not-my-pcs/soroko-roko.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Soloko Loko</a> tar upp en i var sin hand och vi går vidare.Vi kommer till ett större rum med något altare i mitten där det i mitten finns en stor bit fjäll av röd färg hängandes ovanför. Många bänkar runtomkring altaret.<br>\nVi tänker att vi ska offra något på altaret, någon gåva. <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Soroko Roko\" data-href=\"Soroko Roko\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/01_pcs/not-my-pcs/soroko-roko.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Soloko Loko</a> offrar 50gp, jag 10gp och Kealen 3gp. Efter detta går vi till nästa rum som är Artificery. Ett runt rum med mycket braziers så det är ganska upplyst. I mitten finns ett mörkt, djupt, stort hål. Pip pekar åt ett håll o säger att dit ska vi, men åt det hållet finns farliga saker. Men det kan också finnas bra saker.Vi funderar över hålet, och Kaelen slänger ner en tänd fackla där i och den faller läääänge och sen slocknar den bara. Inget ljud eller något. Den där artificern är en jättestor kobold som är elak mot andra kobolds. Pip säger också att han experimenterar på kobolds.\nMen vi vill gå in ändå, så vi öppnar dörrarna till koboldsens rädsla. När vi går in så råkar en av de väldigt rädda koboldsen stöta till en hylla, en flaska trillar ner och går sönder. Ett rosa moln fyller upp en del av rummet och sen det lila som var i sprider sig över golvet i hela rummet. Så fort någon tar ett steg på det så glider man bara vidare i oändlighet typ. Vi går till nästa rum och i mitten är det en enorm, humanoid, statyliknande varelse gjord av kött, utan ansikte. Men med 4 imps, fastkopplade i kedjor som den håller i. Den börjar attackera oss så vi attackerar tillbaks. Det verkade som att impsen styrde golemen genom kedjorna.Jag försöker använda kristallkulan igen och slänger då Scrying.\nFlod av lava, hängbroar. I mitten av denna lavaflod finns en platå med en liten sten-gazebo med ett bord och på bordet en liten ask.\nÄven sen ser jag ett annat rum där det sticker ut ben ur väggarna. Där ser jag ett hav av guld.Vi lyckas ha ihjäl båda golem och dens dragonborn kompis som kom igenom en dörr under fighten. Men vi tog en hel del skada. Vi går in o kollar i andra rum efter detta. Jag o Kaelen går in i första till höger och hittar två items: ett svärd och ett par handskar. Kaelen tar båda itemsen.<br>\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Soroko Roko\" data-href=\"Soroko Roko\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/01_pcs/not-my-pcs/soroko-roko.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Soloko Loko</a> går till nästa rum och kollar efter loot men hittar inget. Han kollar sen i ett annat rum och där är stretchers med många kobolds liggande på där vissa saknar armar och ben. De är experimenterade på. Hittade en bok vid nattduksbordet. På framsidan av boken är 5 drakhuvuden i varsin färg.\nJag hittar också en manual of golems.Vi tar en short rest i tempelrummet. Sen går vi till portalrummet. Det finns som ett 18 sidigt prisma med ett tak och golv (20-sidig tärning typ) i mitten av rummet. Det finns också två ringar i golvet runt prismat med massa olika symboler.<br>\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Soroko Roko\" data-href=\"Soroko Roko\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/01_pcs/not-my-pcs/soroko-roko.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Soloko Loko</a> vill prova att använda portalen så han sätter de två ringarna till Guld och Cirkel. Han får då välja en plats och öppnar en portal till den portalen som fanns under altaret. Den portalen gick till nåt eldigt, varmt ställe. Men mellan de två portalerna i det lilla rummet står en typ demon, helt röd med röda lysande ögon. Den ser oss, drar 2 stora vapen och börjar gå mot vår portal, som <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Soroko Roko\" data-href=\"Soroko Roko\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/01_pcs/not-my-pcs/soroko-roko.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Soloko Loko</a> stänger genom att snurra en cirkel.\nJag öppnar portalen direkt efter han bytt, och då öppnas en portal till nån stor pyramid med mängder av humanoida figurer med lila tentakler i ansiktet. Högst upp på pyramiden är det också en övervuxen stor hjärna. Vi började få lite blickar emot oss och stängde även denna portal ganska fort.<br>Vi vände sen tillbaks ringarna till det första <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Soroko Roko\" data-href=\"Soroko Roko\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/01_pcs/not-my-pcs/soroko-roko.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Soloko Loko</a> hade. Sen försöker jag öppna en portal till skrinet i lavafloden men den vägrar, det funkar inte. Sen provat vi Den Stora Högen som jag också såg i min syn tidigare.\nMed den öppen såg vi många andra mycket större kobolder som lekte med massa items från högen och typ simmade runt och åkte pulka på högen.Om du nånsin befinner dig i en av de djupa duergar städerna, nämn för vem som helst; att du har en tjänst att inhämta från Borb Hammarsköld. Vi går till Zigil och får lite tips. Vi berättar också att de Blå har förstört portalrummet. Sen går vi till skräprummet igen.Vi häller upp lite vin som vi hittade på kroppen från alkemisten. Vi ställer muggen med vinet på pedistalen mha min Rakittens Ethereal Paw. Väl framme så förändras hela pedistalen och upp kommer en kista. I kistan hittar vi 4 saker:\nEn amulet två händer som håller upp mot en sol. I solen står det “+2” En form av stav, en liten pinne i metall. Stålaktig med vingar och röda gems intryckta\n2st spellscrolls Scroll of Earthquake\nScroll of Time Stop <br>Vi går sen till lavarummet och det är ett otroligt stort rum. Det är en lång väg vi behöver ta oss längsmed floden utan att ha nåt att gå på. Vi ser även där vi befinner oss att sten-gazebon är 200ft bort, över lava. <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Soroko Roko\" data-href=\"Soroko Roko\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/01_pcs/not-my-pcs/soroko-roko.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Soloko Loko</a> lyckas flyga över och hämta skrinet och komma tillbaks utan att bli mördad av lava-elementen. Han öppnar skrinet och i där är en påse. I påsen ser han en kortlek, en deck of many things.Och där avslutade vi.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#session"],"headers":[{"heading":"Session Summary","level":2,"id":"Session_Summary_0"},{"heading":"Recap of last session","level":2,"id":"Recap_of_last_session_0"},{"heading":"Session Summary","level":8,"id":"Session_Summary_1"},{"heading":"Log","level":2,"id":"Log_0"}],"links":["01_pcs/not-my-pcs/soroko-roko.html","01_pcs/not-my-pcs/soroko-roko.html","01_pcs/not-my-pcs/soroko-roko.html","01_pcs/tamer-folder/spells.html#Primal Scent","01_pcs/not-my-pcs/soroko-roko.html","01_pcs/not-my-pcs/soroko-roko.html","01_pcs/not-my-pcs/soroko-roko.html","01_pcs/not-my-pcs/soroko-roko.html","01_pcs/not-my-pcs/soroko-roko.html","01_pcs/not-my-pcs/soroko-roko.html","01_pcs/not-my-pcs/soroko-roko.html","01_pcs/not-my-pcs/soroko-roko.html","01_pcs/not-my-pcs/soroko-roko.html","01_pcs/not-my-pcs/soroko-roko.html"],"author":"Rasmus","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/02_journal/other-campaigns/the-redscales/session-02-2024-11-24-blue-vs-red-kobolds.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1732968567189,"modifiedTime":1736873797333,"sourceSize":9909,"sourcePath":"02_Journal/Other campaigns/The Redscales/Session 02 - 2024-11-24 - Blue vs Red Kobolds.md","exportPath":"02_journal/other-campaigns/the-redscales/session-02-2024-11-24-blue-vs-red-kobolds.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":175,"backlinks":["02_journal/other-campaigns/the-redscales/session-03-2024-11-29-blue-vs-red-kobolds.html"],"type":"markdown"},"02_journal/other-campaigns/the-redscales/session-03-2024-11-29-blue-vs-red-kobolds.html":{"title":"Session 03 - 2024-11-29 - Blue vs Red Kobolds","icon":"","description":"<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Soroko Roko\" data-href=\"Soroko Roko\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/01_pcs/not-my-pcs/soroko-roko.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Soloko Loko</a> läser upp instruktionerna som står till kortleken.<br>\n<a href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se?query=tag:DeckofManyThings\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#DeckofManyThings\">#DeckofManyThings</a> <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Soroko Roko\" data-href=\"Soroko Roko\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/01_pcs/not-my-pcs/soroko-roko.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Soloko Loko</a> säger att han kommer dra 5 kort för att det finns 5 chromatic dragons.<br>\nFörsta är Euryale. <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Soroko Roko\" data-href=\"Soroko Roko\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/01_pcs/not-my-pcs/soroko-roko.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Soloko Loko</a> fryser.

När han drar The Moon, så säger han “jag önskar… att jag visste kodordet!”Han går fram till stenen och säger “Void”. Vilket var rätt kodord.\nJag tar sedan Decken och lägger i min väska.Efter ett bra tag kommer båten till oss. På båten är några läskiga filurer, typ elementals, som släpper på oss på båten. När vi kommer på båten, så ringer ett larm och elementerna som släppt på oss vänder emot oss. Det är ett larm för att det kommit inkräktare. Fight börjar.<br>Under fighten som då är <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Soroko Roko\" data-href=\"Soroko Roko\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/01_pcs/not-my-pcs/soroko-roko.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Soloko Loko</a>s duell han fick från the Deck, så blir Kaelen attackerad. Detta känns knasigt för då borde vi kanske få vara med o slåss?<br>\nKaelen tolkar det så och slår tillbaks. Då bryts kortet som <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Soroko Roko\" data-href=\"Soroko Roko\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/01_pcs/not-my-pcs/soroko-roko.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Soloko Loko</a> hade. Duellen är över och han kan inte få en reward längre från den.<br>Vi klarar oss och jag ber min Rakitten använda <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Splicer - Training Paradigm > Battlefield Harvester\" data-href=\"Splicer - Training Paradigm#Battlefield Harvester\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/01_pcs/tamer-folder/splicer-training-paradigm.html#Battlefield Harvester\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Battlefield Harvester</a> för att äta en av elementalsen. Mina companions fick resistance till Slashing.Jag tar sedan en av stavarna de hade, går fram till fronten med staven i marken o säger “Void”. Båten börjar röra sig.\nVi åker framåt och på vägen faller lite stalagtiter som de flesta av oss klarar oss undan.\nLite senare fastnar vi på några stenar i floden som vi försöker lodga oss ifrån. Vi tar oss loss, men lyckas inte styra ordentligt. Vi råkar åka en dålig väg dock o åker igenom där det sprutar lava upp på båten. Flertalet kobolds dör här..Men till slut, kommer vi till parkeringsplatsen för båten, precis intill vägen till stora högen. Vi går av och närmar oss porten till högen. Då kommer en Mephit som plockar upp en kobold och drar iväg, vi hinner inte göra något. Oändliga mängder guld, silver, koppar, electrum fyller utrymmet framför oss. Mängder av kistor och gems finns också över hela ytan. Beltulando.\n00:55\n01:09\n01:33Efter 3 runder av fighting så har marken skakat en hel del. Då ser vi plötsligt en svans med svarta scales som simmar igenom guldet.

Det är någon som vill ha hjälp att städa sin grotta fr.o.m dagens datum (som också fylldes i när jag läste det) till en månad framåt. Längst ner finns en ruta där man kan markera att man accepterar. Vi ska försöka dra men vill bara gräva nån gång till.

Vågorna sköljer som mot en osynlig sköld runt templet. De kan inte slå mot templet i sig.Vi använde oss av Eaglereign för att hjälpa oss till Templet från skeppet.Templet öppnas och vi går in.Jag ser ett par figurer som ser ut som fiskar på två ben. De ser ut som att de har vapen eller liknande på sig. De rör sig bortåt efter en kort stund.Vi börjar gå in och ser strax en väg till vänster och en till höger en till bit bort.Jag tittar in i gångarna och ser statyer i vänstra gången och i gången till höger ser jag ett stort fiskliknande monster med fenor som går längsmed ryggen. Den gömde sig sedan igen.Vi går in i rummet med statyerna. Statyerna har en bägare i ena handen och kniv i andra handen. Vi ser att det är något i bägaren på den första statyn och Haggan stoppar ner fingret och smakar.Hon blir helt borta i blicken och går inte få tag i henne.Efter en kort stund så börjar vi höra ett djupt growlande. Sedan ett något ljusare, och sedan ännu ett till något ljusare.Det tar bara några sekunder sen kommer det tre stycken fiskliknande humanoider; två med spjut och en som verkar vara mer magiker.Haggan pratar om något \"stort öga\" som hon såg en bit bort efter att hon drack den där drycken i bägaren.Det verkar vara samma dryck eller vätska i alla.Vi ser att alla knivar har en symbol på sig, alla olika; en haj, en havsorm, en bläckfisk, en krabba.Vi provar flytta på en av statyerna och försöker hitta något mer, men vi hittar inget.Vi börjar röra oss vidare.Vi kommer till två korsningar, första tar vi höger, andra går vi mot en kista.Haggan går fram och öppnar kistan försiktigt, men blir attackerad från taket. Vi lyckas ha ihjäl den, en Amourphus Blob (?).Kistan verkade vara tom, var nog endast en fälla. Men Tony körde ner handen i kistan och kände en ringbrynja. Hittade en Elven Shirt. Singwin tar på sig den.Vi går tillbaka och svänger första vägen höger när vi kan.I första rummet vi kommer in i finns en Arch av marmor står ovanför en pool med swirling vatten. En Whirlpool, 10-15ft diameter.Vi hittar inget spännande utan går vidare.I nästa rum ser vi fler statyer, men dessa ser ut som bläckfiskarmar/tentakler. Och en bit bort ser vi huvudet/kroppen av en bläckfisk. Hela rummet är fullt av vatten upp till midjan ungefär.Finns en utgång till vänster ett par ft bort och en utgång en bra bit bort på andra sidan rummet. Haggan gick mot bläckfiskhuvudet och då började en tentakel att röra sig mot Haggan.Vi går till rummet jämte och där ser vi en någut upphöjd platå i formen av en perfekt cirkel. Här finns tre utgångar, utöver den som vi kom in i.Jag ställer mig i mitten och då lyser en text upp där inte ens Bagge kan läsa. Haggan kunde dock läsa, och det stod:\"Three sets of challenges. Three sets of tests. Complete them all, and I shall take you to the throneroom's hall\"Kalsh symbol är den som ligger på golvet. Tre vågor som ligger i varandra. Men sen finns ett sett med 3 till. Kanske att symbolernas vågor hör ihop i par.Vi går in i ett rum och där finns en fontän som är tom på vatten. Det står en text på den som Haggan översätter:\"Släck min törst\"Tony pissade i fontänen och det bara försvann. Singwin gick och fyllde Bagge med vatten från Bläckfiskrummet och hällde ut i fontänen, men allt vatten bara försvann. Allt i Singwins väska är nu dyngblött.Detta rummet var det som var på andra sidan sprickorna i början av templet.Vi går till ett annat rum så länge. Nästa rum är otroligt mörkt och vårt ljus som Tony lyser med sitt svärd lyser inte igenom mörkret. Vi tände två braziers på varsin sida.Ser ett rutnät med stenplattor. Alla har runor på toppen.Haggan kände inte igen en av runorna och den tryckte hon på, då åkte den ner i golvet och ljuset lyste vidare till nästa rad. Singwin kände igen symbolen som symbolen för Lyssa.Vi såg sedan en till Symbol av Lyssa som jag tog ett steg till och då lyste nästa rad upp igen. Fortsätter pusslet. Och till slut löser vi det mha Cory och den lilla Örnen jag trollar fram med Eaglerein.Cory hittar en ring och en calligrafipenna. Han tänder två facklor som är på den sidan rummet och hela rummet lyses upp. Inget händer längre när vi lämnar knapparna i golvet.[Ringen Cory hittade: Man kan andas under vatten. Men man blir tung.]{.underline}Tony tröttnade och stack till nästa rum under tiden. Det rummet var ett stort rum med pelare runt om ett typ altare. Altaret har trappor upp för alla sidor. En enorm staty i mitten på altaret. En låda som är tom finns också. Det finns symboler på lådan.\"Bury me with my weapon, let me fight in the afterlife\"Den stora statyn hade ett stort vapen i sten i händerna. Vi hjälptes åt att bära bort vapnet och la det i lådan. Efter en stund så vaknade han och började attackera oss.Efter vi gjort lite skada så började stenen försvinna från statyn och det visade sig vatten under sten-kroppen.Till slut lyckades Tony göra ett sista slag som fick stenkroppen att ramla ihop.Det var typ ett vattenelement under. När Tonys slag gick igenom vattnet så frös en liten del av vattnet till is, vilket verkade sakta ner den lite.Cory gör nåt coolt mot Elementet och får en inspirationVi fick en ide att kanske den kan sugas ner i den där fontänen där vi tidigare hällt vatten. I och med att den bara jagar Haggan så tog Haggan den mot fontänen. På vägen går den förbi mig och jag tar på ringen som Cory hittade och sen går in i elementalen. Tänker att man kanske kan styra elementet på det sättet. Det visar sig att ringen är cursed, Ring of Anchoring. Armen som man har ringen på blir EXTREMT tung och dras nedåt när den kommer i kontakt med vatten, man får även svårt att röra på sig. Det går inte ta av ringen innan Cursen är borta. Cursen går bara att ta bort genom Remove Curse. Att ta på ringen gjorde också så att jag tappade kontakten med Eaglereign...När elementet kommer till fontänen så börjar den sugas ner och försvinner. När den är borta så börjar det komma vatten ur toppen på fontänen och sedan börjar en till våg att fyllas med vatten i centrala rummet.Vi går till rummet med statyerna igen och ser till att alla skålar blir druckna ur. Efter det kollar vi i centrala rummet igen men det finns inte nån mer våg som är fyllld med vatten där.Vi kollar bläckfiskrummet igen. Haggan förvandlar sig till en fisk och kollar lite närmare, då står det följande vid munnen:\"Grant me my treasure and the tides will grant you my favour(?)\"Vi går till rummet där vi slogs tidigare. Vi hittar där en liten staty av en gubbe. Vi lägger den i lådan i rummet och jag går sedan till centrala rummet och ser efter en stund att en till våg blir fylld med vatten. [3 klara]{.underline}.Vi går vidare till nästa rum som var innanför rummet där vi slogs. Ett rum fyllt av pelare, 9st. Det finns ett par lertavlor på en bänk längst bak i rummet, lika många som antalet pelare, 9st. När man rör vid de olika pelarna så hör man ljud i huvudet, eller i alla fall så hör Cory det.Efter lite fundering så kanske det inte handlar om druid-symboler som vi tidigare trott. Men de kan vara beskrivningar av de nio gudarna. Tony som är betydligt mycket mer bildad än oss andra har bra koll på dessa nio. Han tar tag i och börjar rista symboler för de gudarna på lertavlorna.När Tony är klar så går vi tillbaks till rummet och då ser vi en till våg som är fylld med vatten.Vi försöker komma på fler ideer för de sista vågorna.Bagge hjälpte mig tänka lite och det kanske är nåt med bägarna som passar i bläckfisken. Vi går tillbaks till bägarna och märker att när man sträcker sig fram mot en bägare så viks den mot oss. Rör man munnen mot så häller den ner i munnen. Tony provade först och svepte Krabbans bägare (den bytte plats på två attributes stats). Efter det så släppte statyn bägaren. Sen tog jag bläckfiskens bägare (smakade havsvatten. Gick knappt att dricka) och drack upp samt gav till Haggan som fick ge till bläckfisken.Vi gick tillbaks till huvudrummet och då fanns det vatten i alla vågor.Det kom fram en knapp, vi tryckte på den och vi togs till en trappa som leder upp till ett stort tempel, med mängder av fiender i. Där vi pausade för denna session.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#session"],"headers":[{"heading":"Cory Inspiration ","level":2,"id":"Cory_Inspiration_#inspiration_0"}],"links":["?query=tag:inspiration"],"author":"Rasmus","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-15-2023-03-25.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1730964968511,"modifiedTime":1736874134049,"sourceSize":9475,"sourcePath":"02_Journal/Thalbrine - Big campaign/Session 15 - 2023-03-25.md","exportPath":"02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-15-2023-03-25.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":194,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-16-2023-04-02.html":{"title":"Session 16 - 2023-04-02","icon":"","description":"Började med mat runt 17. Började spela strax innan 18.Recap: Vi löste alla pussel o tog oss upp till en stor tempelsal mha en magisk hiss av något slag.Snäckor runt om i hela salen och i rummet vi kom upp i. Det brinner i dem och de avger ljus ifrån sig.Det som går från vänster-höger är djupt vatten, nästan som en vallgrav.Det andra som går nerifrån och upp är knähögt.Haggan ber oss ta bort blodet vi har på oss, för att de vi slogs mot blev tokiga tyckte hon när de kände av blod. Tony tog bort det från sig och Cory. Jag blev skraj när jag hörde det och drack min Bath Potion så att allt verkligen försvinner.Vi funderar en stund på ifall vi kan och hinner ta en short rest. Vi försöker detta då inte de i salen har närmat sig något.Vi smyger oss mot salen, och Cory observerar att alla fiskfolk är borta. Vi smyger oss in vid sidan av, inte i vattnet.Haggan observerar att det är något lurigt i taket (nåt som verkar påvisa nån form av Hivemind eller \"Råttkung\").Vi ser efter en stund 4st fiskfolk som börjar komma fram bakom de bakre två pelarna.En till varelse kommer fram längst fram på den övre delen. En stor ryggfena sträcker sig över typ hela ryggen och en spetsig nos så som en haj.Den sträcker upp sina armar mot taket och vattnet här inne börjar få stora stora vågor.I respons på detta, så säger Tony: \"Yormund (?), ta denna platsen!\"Alla fiskdjuren förändrade sina uttryck och den längst fram tog ner sina armar och höll de istället för sina gälar.När vi kommer fram till kanten ser vi att det finns två hajar I vattnet där nere.Combat börjar med att den kommer en stor tsunami på vänstra sidan av salen. Den börjar framme vid pelaren längst bort och sköljer hela vägen till porten vi kom ifrån. Singwin rusade till mittersta knähöga vattnet där han inte fick tsunamin över sig, De andra blev blöta.Vi lyckas vinna striden mot de som vi slogs mot, och en av dem medvetslös.Tony tar upp den läskigare fisken upp på ett altare och skär sig själv i handen samt spiller det över altaret och den döda kroppen.Det låg en stor sfär, mattsvart i altaret. Haggan tog den ur bordet.När Haggan sedan kom till det djupa vattnet så stelnade det till och de kunde gå på det.Vi går ut och ut genom hela templet. Singwin känner på vägen att Örn-hansken känns lite konstig. Den verkar inte gå att använda.Skeppet är en bra bit bort. Under tiden de tar sig hit så försöker Haggan kontrollera sfären. Singwin får kolla på den men kan inte göra det, det bara smärtar i huvudet. Haggan får tillbaks den.Haggan lyckas forma vatten utefter hennes vilja och sen går hon upp på vattnet. Den stelnar till och vi alla går på vattnet upp på skeppet.Vi får en lugn resa hem och tar oss av skeppet och börjar rida hemåt. Haggan på vägen hem, slänger undan sig masken som hon tidigare haft under all tid.Vi tar oss in till Innet och vi blir välkomna av Harry och han hälsar att Gideon vill träffa oss.Vi går in till Gideon och Haggan släpper den på hans skrivbord.Gideon sträcker fram händerna och lyfter upp sfären utan att röra den fysiskt.Han säger att det var bra jobbat och att det är väl dags för vår belöning. Att vi ska få träffa en bekant. Han ber oss ta tag i hans hand och vi gör detta. Så snart sista handen är på hans, så sveps vi iväg och förflyttas till en ny plats.Vi ska få träffa en bekant till Gideon. Vi verkar nu vara hos honom eller på hans kontor eller liknande.Antek Absomagus.Han ska ge oss var och en, en gåva som är given specifikt för våra behov just nu. Han är otroligt dyr i drift, men hans egenskaper och vad han kan hjälpa med är väldigt många.Gideon knackar på och dörren öppnas av Amtec.Mycket böcker överallt, en hel del växter längs med väggarna.Ett bord i trä av massor av olika träslag som skapar ett fint mönster på bordet. Ett gäng stolar runt om.En liten varelse med mörka fjädrar och vass näbb. Stor hatt.Han ber oss en och en komma fram. Han pekar på Singwin och säger \"Du! Du är sist!\". Sedan säger han \"Du först!\" till Tony.Tony går fram och Amtec pratar lite med honom. Ber att få kolla på Tonys svärd. Han tittar och inspekterar svärdet och pratar om det lite.Sedan får Tony välja mellan 3 olika grejer eller att uppgradera svärdet ytterligare.Alla tre får några olika val att göra. Och till sist, jag, Singwin.Först och främst säger Amtec att \"nää så här kan vi inte ha det\" och använder Remove Curse på mig. Jag tar kvickt av mig både ringen och halsbandet. Känner en stor lättnad.Han ger mig ett val på tre olika saker också.En Avian Circlet, en liten Rare rod eller ett pound med starmetal.Singwin har i detta skedet inte bestämt sig.Han och Cory känner igen namnet Absomagus från när de gick runt i ~staden~ och försökte hitta en magisk butik.Anteks butik-grej heter \"Antek Absomagus Absolut Magiska Antikvariat\"Session avslutas med att vi även går upp i Level 5. <a href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se?query=tag:levelup\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#levelup\">#levelup</a>","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#session"],"headers":[],"links":["?query=tag:levelup"],"author":"Rasmus","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-16-2023-04-02.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1730964970828,"modifiedTime":1736874151677,"sourceSize":5762,"sourcePath":"02_Journal/Thalbrine - Big campaign/Session 16 - 2023-04-02.md","exportPath":"02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-16-2023-04-02.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":195,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-17-2023-04-15-olof-dm.html":{"title":"Session 17 - 2023-04-15 - Olof-DM","icon":"","description":"Började äta mat o så runt 17.Började spela omkring: 18:00.Recap: Tog oss igenom slutet av templet och gav den stora svarta pärlan till Gideon. Han tog oss därefter till Antek Absomagus och hans butik. Han gav oss lite val av gåvor.Vi gick upp i level 5.Fick 1 pound Starmetal. Krävs vissa förhållanden för att kunna arbeta med den på rätt sätt.The Redsmiths är ett typ gille av Dvärgsmedjefolk. Jobbar åt de högsta av alla dvärgar. De gjorde armor och sånt till kungligheter. En Redsmith hammare kan användas till att smida med Starmetal.Måste hålla temperaturen uppe hela tiden för att smida Starmetal, annars blir den bräcklig.Vi plockar våra grejer och Gideon ber oss ta hänga med tillbaks då han har lite brådskande ärende.Frågar Antek hur vi kan ta oss till honom igen om det skulle bli intressant. Han hänvisar till Gideon.Vi tar oss tillbaks till Gideons kontor och där bankar det på dörren.Gideon öppnar och en gråhudad alv stormar in och klagar på att en han rest med i två månader är hemsk att vara med. Han säger att hans kollega han rest med ALDRIG, SLUTAR, PRATA! Och han är trött på det. Han som pratar så mycket hette något i stil med \"Caer\".Giden ber honom ta det lugnt då han har besök och han ska kika på det framöver. Alven går ut.Gideon säger att han genast vill skicka iväg oss på annat, då det finns ett relativt brådskande ärende. Han ger oss ett brev, bifogat till höger här. Och nedanför brevet finns den bifogade dikten.Gideon ber oss att senast dra iväg på detta imorgon bitti. Vi blir nog borta 2 veckor eller något.Det är sydvästra regionen av Aarid Province. Cave of Echoes.Jag drar direkt efter besöket hos Gideon ner till <a data-href=\"Brogho\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/brogho.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Brogho</a> för att leverera hans knakpulver. Fick 80GP + 1 Potion (Potion of Diminution). Där säljer jag också de två cursed itemsen, Ring of Anchoring och Periapt of Reflection. De var han villig att betal 210GP för efter lite bartering. Även en Basilisk Dagger säljs där, 40GP. Totalt 330GP + 1 Potion.Sedan rider jag tillbaks till gillet.Vi tar en longrest till morgonen. När vi går ner till Harry för frukost så ger han oss ett brev med lite prylar i som Cory tydligen lämnat till oss.Vi läser brevet. Se till höger, markerat med rött.Cory har lämnat oss för sin syster verkar det som. Väldigt oklart.Ut ur Gideons rum kommer en stor stor man som ropar högt: \"Letar efter en grupp på 3 som bl.a har en fågel i gruppen\".Jag svarar att \"Det är nog vi!\"Han kommer till oss och han pratar med oss lite.Caer heter han. Han ska tydligen vara med oss istället för Cory. Gideon har satt honom på vårt uppdrag.Vi äter upp vår frukost och börjar röra oss utåt.**Jacob och Olof byter plats, fysiskt.**Visar sig att Olof ska DMa idag och Jacob spela Caer.Caer trollar fram en stor älg med magi och vi rider av.Vi kommer fram till Aarid Province och strax efter hängbron efter portalen så tar vi och pausar för natten.Tony har växt ut ett stort skägg under dagen. Mycket större än han haft tidigare.Caer tar fram lite mat som han lagar och äter, stora kycklingben.Han säger att han gärna lär känna oss lite mer, då vi inte pratat så mycket ännu. Vi pratar och lär känna varandra lite mer, framförallt Caer.Han har en curse på sitt blod.Vi sover för natten.Vi rider vidare på morgonen, på vägen hela vägen ner förbi och strax utanför krysset vi ser nu så funderar vi lite på hur vi tar oss in.Vi sitter av och går med hästarna in igenom skogen. Vi kommer ut ur skogen och mer till stenigt landskap.Hästarna kan inte fortsätta med oss. Vi spenderar lite tid på hur vi ska hantera hästarna men vi ska försöka hitta något med tak, typ en grottöppning, och lämna hästarna där tillsammans med Fangorn(?), Caers älg.Vi börjar leta lite efter en grottöppning där vi delvis kan lämna hästarna, men också där vi kan lämna hästarna.Jag skickar upp min örn med Eaglereign och den letar efter någon grottöppning. Efter ett tag hittar den en öppning. Vi tar och börjar röra oss dit med hästarna. Vi kan inte ta dit hästarna dock verkar vi se sen, för krångligt att få upp dem dit.Caer pratar med hästarna och de är ok med att bli parkerade en liten bit bort. Vi tar ut lite mat och binder fast hästarna.Vi går sedan till grottöppningen vi hittat.Haggan ser något ljusgrönt en bra bit bort och uppåt på berget. Jag skickar till slut örnen upp dit och då ser vi att det är ett hål i berget och där nere växer ett träd och det var löven som stack upp ur hålet och därmed det som de såg också.Vi smyger oss in i grottan. Vi hör ett \"hooande\" inifrån grottan. När vi kommer närmare så hör vi mer av det.Vi kommer till en stor grotta och börjar kolla runt. Vi hittar då en Owlbear med 3st ungar nedanför. Det var nog de som lät innan.Den verkar inte aggressiv, utan står mest och vaktar sina ungar.Vi börjar leta runt i grottan, överallt där Owlbearen inte är. Vi hittar bara mossa och vägg.Haggan gjorde om sig till nån gas och flög runt lite. Hon hittade då till slut ett hål strax ovanför där Owlbearen befinner sig.Hon kommer tillbaks och berättar detta.Jag försöker prata med Owlbearen (mha. Kindred Speech) och övertyga den om att flytta på sig lite så vi kan kolla. Den verkar inte övertygad, men Caer ger mig lite kött och då verkar den bli mer intresserad. Lyckas då få den att flytta sig en bit bort till där jag la köttet på marken.Vi försöker sedan med lite krångel ta oss upp i hålet och det löser sig bra då Caer är väldigt stark.En ganska stor tunnel kommer vi till där. Ganska bred och hög, en bra bit lång. Vi går framåt, Haggan känner efter en kort stund en doft av rök. Vi funderar på då om röken har något med dikten och göra, det stod ju något om rök där i.Vi går vidare. Snart känner vi alla doften av rök.Vi kommer till en liten öppning. Där finns det två bedrolls, en nyligen släckt brasa mellan dem. Lite packning, så som kastruller o annat smått o gott. Några tunnor står också här.Caer och Tony tar varsitt äpple som ligger i en av tunnorna.Vi går vidare framåt och efter en stund kommer vi till ett vägskäl. Vi svänger vänster och går vidare till ett till vägskäl och vi svänger skarpt höger vidare. Där verkar det bli ljusare desto längre vi går.Vi kommer än en gång till en öppning. Där finns det är det väldigt mycket flora, ormbunkar, mossa, växter och även det där trädet som jag hittade tidigare mha örnen.Haggan går fram till det gröna och tar något steg in i det gröna.När hon kommer in i det gröna kommer det fram två vines från ormbunkarna som försöker slå henne.Vi börjar skjuta och slå lite av vinesen som då attackerar tillbaks på oss.De tar tag och sliter lite i oss och grapplar oss. Vi försöker dra oss ut ur det gröna området där vinesen attackerar oss. Det finns en väg ut på andra sidan av grottan från där vi kom in.Den börjar luta något nedåt och jag halkar och börjar glida nedåt, slår i Haggan som också välter. Vi glider in mot Tony och han hinner flytta på sig, men Caer gör inte det. Vi tre glider ner och stannar när vägen börjar plana ut igen.Caer hjälper oss komma ner när det sedan blir lite brantare, som ett stup.När vi kommit ner så kollar vi bortåt men ser där en port med braziers vid sidan av.Vi ser 4 figurer, humanoids, vid denna porten på andra sidan chasmen vi klättrade ner i.En röst från andra sidan grottan säger \"Det är bara att öppna den, Baer\"","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#session"],"headers":[],"links":["03_npcs/brogho.html"],"author":"Rasmus","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-17-2023-04-15-olof-dm.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1730964969135,"modifiedTime":1736874166428,"sourceSize":8361,"sourcePath":"02_Journal/Thalbrine - Big campaign/Session 17 - 2023-04-15 - Olof-DM.md","exportPath":"02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-17-2023-04-15-olof-dm.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":196,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-18-2023-04-23-olof-dm.html":{"title":"Session 18 - 2023-04-23 - Olof-DM","icon":"","description":"Började spela omkring: 16:00. Käk innan dess.Recap från förra session:Den vi tror är Baer svarar på frågan med att \"Jag tänker inte öppna den\"Den som ställde frågan säger att \"Jag önskar att det inte skulle bli så här. Vi har vart här i en vecka nu och du vill fortfarande inte öppna.\"De diskuterar lite och det kommer ett par personer till.Vi hör även lite namn, bl.a Weston som vi tror är den som ställde frågan. Weston var även han som ledde partyt som var försvunnet.Caer tar ställning och vi börjar gå för att hitta en väg fram. Vi råkar då komma tillbaks till den lilla campen som vi hittade. Vi vänder och tar oss tillbaks till där vi kunde se de där personerna vid porten. Där hör vi en stor stor smäll som ekar. Visar sig att det var porten som smällde igen. Personerna som var där är borta.Vi hittar en väg och börjar gå mot porten. Vi kommer till ännu ett litet stup typ och vi tar oss över mha Caer som kastar mig och Haggan.Fortsätter gå mot porten. Väl framme ser vi att dörren är utsmyckad med runor, men även dörrkarmen är det. Tony ser att det är på Dvärgiska. Det är 7 cirklar på karmen som alla innehåller 2 runor.Det står följande:ME DE JF BB LE GB ED13 5 - 4 5 - 10 6 - 2 2 - 12 5 - 7 2 - 5 4Och sedan ovanför stod det även en text till, som var följande:\"Tell me you know the consequences that might befall, and you may enter the gate into this hall\"Caer och Tony blir fundersam och fortsätter utforska lite i stora grottöppningen vi är i.De hittade en lapp där det stod \"Bokstävernas plats i alfabetet är nyckeln\"EMPTIED, WILL, VAULT, DARKNESS, THAT(IS), IF, AWAKEDARKNESS WILL AWAKE IF THE VAULT THAT(IS) EMPTIEDEfter MYCKET om och men lyckades vill till slut.Det var bokstävernas motsvarande siffror för deras plats i alfabetet, och sedan var första bokstavens siffra vilken rad, och andra siffran vilket ord i dikten som vi skulle använda.Direkt inne ser vi mängder av skelett på marken av flera olika raser.Vi börjar gå och försöker utforska. Ett EXTREMT stort ställe med OÄNDLIGA dörrar och korridorer.Hittar lite pengar. Vi fortsätter framåt uppför mängder av trappor.Vi fortsätter massa trappor och sen hittar vi en intristning på golvet nedanför en stor port där det står:\"If you truly knep the consequences that stood above the door, you would never had set foot on this floor\"Vi går in genom porten och där finns 4 statyer på var sida, till höger och vänster om oss. Den tredje statyn till höger har fallit på marken och på den sitter en person. Han har fina kläder, röda, vita med gulddetaljer.Han börjar prata med oss, \"Ni tog er tid\". Det var Weston Underhay. Det är något de letar efter, som de behöver. Något för att avsluta kriget som är på ytan.Han vill ha vår hjälp att hämta det objektet.Caer går fram och ser lite läskig ut.Han ber oss hänga med. Vi går en liten bit och möts av ett gäng med folk.En dragonborn, en halvorc och en människa. Människans händer var bundna.Ser en människa (?) en liten bit åt sidan. Bakom denne står en kvinna med barn.Rakt fram I rummet står en till person vänd bortåt från oss. Nära en bro som går över ett stup. Caer går fram några steg till mot Weston och hotar lite, med hammaren i hand.Lite diskussion framgår och Weston försöker övertala oss om att vi ska hjälpa dem.Den här prylen de vill ha ska tydligen gå att kontrollera orcer med och därmed kan man avsluta kriget där.De bakom Weston flyttar på sig och då ser vi en kvinna med ett barn som båda är fastbundna och en annan dam med kniv står framför.Tony frågar Baer något på dvärgiska och han svarar med att skaka på huvudet. Då svarar Weston till Tony nånting på dvärgiska och sedan frågar han, \"så, vad tänker ni?\".Caer säger att ja, vi kör väl då.Vi går fram mot bron och där står en gammal krokig man. Nån trollkarl typ.Singwin, Tony, Caer och dragonborn-damen blir pekade på och de ber oss att gå ut med Weston.Haggan vill också med oss, så hon börjar gå. Men snabbt därefter får hon en stor hand på axeln, halvorcen. Haggan skriker lite åt han och då reagerar Caer och höjer hammaren åt honom och säger \"Att inte röra är väl tvåvägs?\". Weston ber han lossa handen och halvorcen tar bort sin hand. Caer noterar att halvorcen ser lite osäker ut över situationen.Vi går ut och över hela bron ut på den stora plattformen.Vi hör en röst på dvärgiska som ekar i hela grottan, Tony översätter:\"You are not supposed to be here, go back\"Weston hotar igen med dem på andra sidan bron och ber oss stanna kvar.Han klättrar upp lite mot pedistalen, där det högst upp sitter ihop med en kista i sten. Weston ber Tony hänga med upp och frågar lite om kistan. Tony tror inte att vi kommer ut levande. Weston säger att han tror visst att det går.Weston öppnar kistan. Inget händer. Men det kommer ett litet dovt blått ljus från kistan.Inuti finns en till kista, helt svart med guldiga detaljer.Caer frågar igen om vad prylen gör och vad den används till. Weston svarar inte solklart. Det får Caer att bli lite deppig och han transformerar till sin andra skepnad, björn.Caer tyckte inte om det helt och säger \"jaha, ni vill göra på det sättet\". Han börjar sträcka sig efter kistan. Tony svarar på det genom att dra honom bort från den och slå honom.Då kommer en skepnad i hög fart och tar tag i kistan. I samband med det hör vi att ett gäng statyer börjar röra på sig runtomkring, en jättestor i ena hörnet och 3 mindre i motsatt hörn.Det visar sig va dragonborn-bruden som tog kistan och hon ger den till Weston direkt.Sen börjar encounter och fight bryta ut:","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#session"],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"Rasmus","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-18-2023-04-23-olof-dm.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1730964969159,"modifiedTime":1736874198397,"sourceSize":6639,"sourcePath":"02_Journal/Thalbrine - Big campaign/Session 18 - 2023-04-23 - Olof-DM.md","exportPath":"02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-18-2023-04-23-olof-dm.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":197,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-19-2023-05-05-olof-dm.html":{"title":"Session 19 - 2023-05-05 - Olof-DM","icon":"","description":"Började spela omkring: 16:30Recap: Masken som Weston o Co var ute efter trillade ner I stupet när han föll ihop.

Singwin har pratat med honom men han vill bara ta en titt på masken, inget annat.Vi fortsätter slåss.Under fightens gång trollade Singwin fram en liten Fey fågel som jag skickade ner för att hämta masken.

Klockan är inte allt för sent, men ni somnar fort och bekvämt ändå. Ni går upp på morgonen som vanligt, Hilmia har ni inte sett röken av sedan hon begav sig ut mot skogen utan att säga ett ord igårkväll.

Eller tänkte du något annat?\"Tony slänger en tanke på vad man ens skulle kunna göra, nu när inget quest väntade enligt Gideon så kanske man ska hitta på något eget.Singwin skakar på huvudet tillbaka; \"Nej asså jag skulle bara vilja hitta en såndära hammare som den lilla fågel-herren sa var bra.\"\"Hammare?\"\"Ja hammare, en såndär magisk sådan, Redsmith\"Tony rycker på axlarna. \"Ja kör på du, jag kommer inte på något faktiskt\"Singwin byter samtalsämne till Haggan istället, undrandes när hon kommer tillbaka.De hör en skrovlig röst bort i rummet, och Caer kommer och ställer sig bredvid deras bord.\"Hallå där mina vänner, ville tacka för det lyckade arbetet! Jag ska bege mig iväg nu på morgonkvisten, ingen vila för den hjälpande handen!\"Tony svarar med lite extra på-bredd sympati; \"Nej men så är det ju!\"\"Ja iallafall så ville jag säga ett lycka till i framtiden, ni har varit väldigt välkomnande för mig, om vi någonsin arbetar i framtiden igen så ska ni veta att jag alltid har era ryggar. Ha det fint nu vänner!\" Med ett brett leende så vänder han sig vidare och går ut från Capers. På bordet har han lämnat en lite pengapung rasslandes med guld.Hilmia återvänder inte förrän senare på dagen, inte längre lika nedlåten och grumpy, utan med godare mod uppe.\"Jahaja mina vänner... vart ska vi nu?\"Tony och Singwin tittar lite på varandra, innan Tony svarar. \"Ja asså vi vet ju inte riktigt\"\"Vet inte?\"\"Nej asså det är bara Singwin som vet lite vad han vill göra, du har inget du vill hitta på?\"Haggan ger ifrån sig ett litet \"Hmmmm\", innan hon svarar: \"Nej jag hade den där ön jag ville åka till, men det var tydligen inte så lätt... Nej, annars åker jag vart som helst, vart är Cory?\"Efter instämmande att de inte vet när han kommer tillbaka så bestämmer de sig för en plats att åka. Tony minns äntligen hans lilla ärende i Bastions Shore, man kanske trots allt hinner med en resa dit. För vinets skull.\"Nej men du Singwin, det finns massa massa hantverkare på en ö söder om Aarid Province\"\"Gör det?\" undrar Singwin frågande.\"Ja ja, massa hantverkare, smeder, snickare, skulptörer. Hela köret alltså! Det måste ju finnas någon där som vet något eller?\"\"Ja det kanske det gör, jag vet inte iallafall\" Svarar Singwin.\"Men hur kommer man dit då Tony?\"Tony kommer på sig själv. \"Ja, man eh, tar en båt. Fast jag vet inte varifrån är bäst\"\"Då får vi väl hitta det.\" Konstaterar Haggan.------ Session börjar på riktigt ------Vi funderar lite på hur vi ska ta oss dit, till Bastion Shore. Vi går till Gideon och han tipsar om att Ingmouth har båtar som går dit. Vi tänker att vi drar till Ingmouth på Aarid Province.Tony och Haggan drar ut och laddar Tonys ring med lite spells.Vi bestämmer oss för att ta stora fågeln hela vägen och jag börjar trolla fram den. Efter en timme drar vi oss.Väl framme landar vi i Ingmouth och möts av mängder av folk. Alla stirrar på oss och på stora örnen. En snubbe kommer fram med fiskespjut i hand och ropar högt att \"Ni trollkarlar är inte välkomna här!\". Vi diskuterar lite och kommer fram till slut till att vi endast vill ha en båt vidare till Bastion Shore. Det godtas, mot betalning. Vi fick absolut inte stanna där till dagen efter. Vi blir ledda hela vägen till hamnen och till en kapten med båt/skepp. Han heter Tony.Det blir en tät dimma snabbt efter att vi drar iväg med båten. Det är pga en dam som står framme på båten och skapar den, så vi håller oss relativt osedda för andra ting ute på havet.Vi pratar lite med kaptenen om magiker och annat under resans gång.Vi kommer fram och får veta hur båten kommer gå.Till Bastion Shore en kväll, nästa dag tillbaks till Ingmouth, dan efter till Bastion Shore och sen efter 3 dagar totalt åker den tillbaks till Ingmouth.Vi går fram till en skylt och försöker hitta lite information om vart man kan ta sig.Hittar en sovplats som heter \"The Bards and the Bees\".Frågar Tony om det stod något om Redsmith på kartan.\nHan frågar mig \"Det kan du väl kolla själv?\"\n\"nej, det kan jag inte. Jag kan inte läsa.\"\nTony och Haggan svarar \"Skojar du eller? Är du på riktigt?\"\n\"Jag har aldrig kunnat läsa ju\"\n\"Men det har jag sett att du gjort förr?\" - Tony\n\"Nä, det är Bagge som läst åt mig\" Och jag tar fram väskan och han pratar högt till dem.\nVi pratar sedan om att de nu vet att väskan kan prata och är sentient, vem Stora G är mm.\nPlötsligt säger Bagge att han har ett uppdrag som kan gynna mig personligen. Stora G hälsade.<a data-href=\"Bag Quest 4\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/05_quests/bag-quests/bag-quest-4.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Bag Quest 4</a><br>\nRing of Indiscretion till <a data-href=\"Semil Wildmagic\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/semil-wildmagic.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Semil Wildmagic</a>\nIn Griffon Menagerie\n24 hours\n1 Arcane EssenceVi går till the Bards and Bees. Lyser en del i fönstrena, i röd färg.Går in och ser där att mycket rött sammetstyg finns på många ställen. Ett litet larm går och vi möts snart av en alvkvinna i mycket sensuell klädsel och frågar oss \"nöje eller vila?\"Liliana heter hon. Man kan få \"nöje\" och då per timme betala ett gäng GP för dans mm i öppna rummet, eller 18GP per timme för privata akter.En liten svit kostar 8GP per natt.Varje svit har 4 bäddar.Vi tar en svit och rör oss mot rummet. Rum 28.Allt inne i rummet får användas och konsumeras som man önskar när man hyr det.Vi sover gott och får 1D10 tempHP efter vi sovit där. Öppnar dörren ut och får vår fina frukost där och äter oss mätta.Vi hittar ett par gubbar som tillhör The Golden Hand, en workers guild. De pekar oss eller framförallt Tony åt rätt håll för att hitta den han letar efter.Vi kommer till the Workers' District.Det är mycket ljud hela tiden och överallt från folk som bankar, spikar o håller på. Väldigt många varuhus här omkring också.Tony hittar en skylt där det står något om \"redsmiths\" eller något och vi går ditåt. Han undrar även ifall det går att göra hans svärd lite vassare. Det kan eventuellt gå men kan vara dyrt.Vi kommer till en stor smedja som har en stor röd hand på dörren med en guldig hand i den. Vi hör väldigt mycket ljud med klinkanden och hammarslag.Ser många dvärgar, ett par dragonborn, gnomes och ett par feathren(!).Haggan tål inte värmen och elden och väljer att stanna utanför.Jag går mot en av de flera Feathren som var och jobbade här. Han har huvudet som en Örn och något rödare/orangeare tassar. Jag säger hej och han svarar och frågar ifall jag ska börja arbeta här. Svarar nej, är på besök då jag behöver lite hjälp med en typ av smide jag ska greja med. Säger tyst att jag har fått tag i en liten bit Starmetal. Han blir tyst och frågar ifall jag är seriös. Jag nämner att jag behöver hjälp att smida med det och han pekar mig upp mot han som jobbar på den största smeden, Tome.Han noterar sedan min väska och bugar för mig och säger att \"det måste vara en ära\". \"Ja, det är det\" svarar jag och går upp.Jag rör mig upp mot den stora smeden. För varje steg man tar upp mot den så blir det tyngre och tyngre att gå på grund av den höga temperaturen som blir starkare och starkare före varje steg.Kommer upp och ser en otroligt grov dvärg som smider för fullt där uppe.Ropar på han men inget svar. Jag går en bit fram och tar fram min Starmetal-klump och visar. Då går det otroligt fort till att han tar upp den och kollar. Han frågar hur jag fick tag i den och jag svarar att det var en gåva för ett arbete jag gjort åt några personer med mycket pengar.Han pratar lite om vad som krävs för att smida.Redsmith Hammer krävs för att hantera.Utöver det, så snart metallen börjar kallna/stelna så är den omöjlig att forma. Försöker man slå den då så blir det inte helt bra. Det kan explodera eller annat smått och gått.Han erbjöd sig att hjälpa mig.Han önskar få hjälp i utbyte mot att hjälpa mig smida Starmetalen.Han har en brorsdotter som blivit mördad.<br><a data-href=\"Tarr Redsmith\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Tarr Redsmith</a> heter hans bror. Han önskar få hämnd för detta.Längst ner, två gator bort. Ovanför dörren har han en stenbyst av Harvi.Jag fick ett halsband som jag ska ta till hans bror och han fyller sedan i resten. Han har även en fundering på vilka som kan ligga bakom, \"The Rattigang\". Ett gäng som finns i stan. Han hade hittat en liten läderlapp från en skida nära mordplatsen som endast tillhör detta gäng.Går sedan ut från detta och diskuterar med Haggan och Tony. Berättar vad som krävs och vad han kan göra för mig. De accepterar något men när jag nämner att det måste lösas till imorn så undrar de lite hur vi ska hinna det och det andra uppdraget.Vi kommer fram till att jag går själv och fixar väsk-uppdraget och Haggan o Tony drar till Tonys ställe med öl han ville till.Jag hittar Griffons Menagerie och går in. Möts av en söt liten varelse som leder mig till Semil Wildmagic efter att jag frågat om den kan det. Går upp för en lång lång trappa som går runt och runt tornet.Jag leds till en Feathren. Det är Semil.\nHan möter min blick och säger tyst till sin kompis på axeln \"Ser du? Nu kommer han!\"\nVi pratar lite och han nämner att jag nog inte vet varför jag är här.Jag möts av mängder av olika små griffons i olika färger och med olika typer av djurblandningar.\nHan förklarar att det nog är så att mitt namn Mistwalker inte är rätt.\nMistwalker var namnet på dem som var Stora G's Gard.\nDet stämmer inte för mig längre, då jag nu bara är en courier.\nJag har nog tagit det beslutet själv, för man blir vanligtvis inte en courier efter att man varit i Garden. Det kan ha varit delvis för att man är väldigt låst som en Mistwalker. Man är begränsad i vart man kan resa och vad man kan göra.\nSom Courier får man vara mycket friare och kan vara lite var man vill utan större krav.Han har en crest med en symbol, en Gyllene Hand. Visar sig att Semil är högsta hönset i hela det gillet.38 år är jag tydligen, berättar Semil för mig.Han visar mig en stor kristallkula och i den kunde jag se minne från den mördades sista sekunder samt en liten tid när den antagliga mördaren går mot sin hemvist.Jag ser från en liten flickas synvinkel. Hon blir huggen med en yxa i magen. En man med långsmalt manligt ansikte med spetsigt öra, inget ansiktshår stegar över henne och synen tar slut. Mörkhårig.Jag ser baksidan av ett skepp. Med ett jättelångt namn med utstickande träbokstäver. En gallerdörr stängs. Sedan går han väldigt långt i kloakerna till höger och vänster och kommer till slut fram till en stenvägg. Där trycker han på 3 olika stenar och sedan öppnas en dörr som var tidigare osynlig och sen tar synen slut.Tackar för mig och rör mig tillbaks mot smeden där vi skulle mötas.Vi pratar lite och jag berättar lite om vad jag fått reda om mig själv och lite om uppdraget. Vi är på väg till hamnen vid crafting-distriktet för att leta efter ett skepp med ett långt namn som har utstickande bokstäver.Vi hittar inte någon som passar perfekt för detta men en väldigt lik. Vi går till vanliga hamnen och hittar där ett vettigt skepp som även har en kloak med galler-ingång bakom sig. Vi går dit och går in och letar oss till slut fram till en sådan vägg jag såg i synen.Lyckas låsa upp den på samma sätt som i synen. När dörren sedan högt öppnas så hör vi metalliska ljud innifrån och ser sedan en alv med knivar i hand.Vi börjar fightas.Vi lyckas knocka honom och de andra två lämnade oss då ifred. Vi lensade stället och tar sedan med den knockade alven på Tonys axlar ut på gatan och mot smedjan där Tome håller hus.Vi möts av mängder av blickar av folk på vägen. Även några vakter. De frågar oss vad som försigår och ställer lite fler frågor. Vi lyckas övertala dem att inte ta den medvetslösa kroppen men de skulle prompt hänga med oss till vår svit. Vi går dit och låtsas sedan fixa hans sår och hela honom medan vakterna väntade utanför.Efter ett tag gick de iväg från vårt rum och vi kom fram till att vi fyller väskan med kroppen. 10 minuters andning i väskan.Vi går ut och rusar sedan till smedjan. Vi springer rätt upp och möter Tome. Vi häller ut kroppen. I respons drar han i en stor kedja och då slår en sjukt stor hammare i ett stort städ. Låter riktigt högt i hela smedjan. Efter det så går samtliga inuti smedjan ut och det blir tomt. Han upptäcker sedan att han inte är död.Vi säger att det är nog mer värt för er att göra jobbet snarare än oss.Han säger att \"inte jag, men min bror\". Han tar upp kroppen med en hand och börjar gå nedåt och utåt. Vi får vänta på hans kontor så länge.Efter 2 timmar kommer han tillbaks. Vi har under tiden blivit servda av hans receptionist. Han kommer in och tackar stort för jobbet.Tony frågar lite om lite electrum han hittade där vi slogs mot alven. Tome säger att det är relativt oanvändbart här, då det är en \"underground\"-valuta. Han erbjuder sig ta det ändå, och slänger fram två 40GP-bars med Mithril. Tony tar upp dessa.Jag ger tillbaks halsbandet vi fick låna.Börjar diskutera med Tony om de där Mithrilet han tog och att jag gärna vill ha det så jag kan börja smida lite igen. Han totalvägrar och snabbt därpå ropar Tome att han INTE vill ha något gräl just nu på hans kontor.Vi ursäktar oss, tackar för hjälpen och vi går ut.Tome avslutar med att säga att vi ses imorgon bitti, i gryningen runt 6:00.Vi går ut och fortsätter diskutera lite, sen springer Tony på sitt möte han skulle ha.Jag och Haggan drar istället till vårt hotellrum och betalar för en till natt.Dagen efter kommer och jag går ner till forgen.Pratar med Tome, hela forgen är tom och han går igenom hur man går tillväga.\"Låt Starmetalen säga sitt, den formar sig själv. Det är upp till dig att inse dess potential\" - TomeSingwin spenderar hela dagen till att smida. Under hela dagen får jag hjälp från Tome. Det gick helt ok, det var svårt att tala med starmetalen och inse dess potential och vad den vill, men det gick. Väl insett gick det väldigt smidigt att smida klart.Det slutliga itemet blev \"Gauntlet of Eldritch Ferocity\" (höger handske).","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#session"],"headers":[{"heading":"Semil Wildmagic","level":4,"id":"Semil_Wildmagic_0"}],"links":["05_quests/bag-quests/bag-quest-4.html","03_npcs/semil-wildmagic.html",".html"],"author":"Rasmus","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-20-2023-05-15.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1730964968340,"modifiedTime":1736873250712,"sourceSize":15739,"sourcePath":"02_Journal/Thalbrine - Big campaign/Session 20 - 2023-05-15.md","exportPath":"02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-20-2023-05-15.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":199,"backlinks":["01_pcs/singwin-mistwalker-folder/while-playing/new-information.html"],"type":"markdown"},"02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-21-2023-05-23.html":{"title":"Session 21 - 2023-05-23","icon":"","description":"Jag o Filip på plats 16ish, Linus 17.Recap: Vi drog till Bastion Shore för att Tony ville snacka lite om vin-leveranser och sånt med någon leverantör där, och Singwin fick höra att det kan finnas duktiga smeder där.Vi drog dit och jag träffade Tome Redsmith som till slut hjälpte mig crafta ett item med Starmetal-klumpen jag hade. Träffade även Semil, högsta hönset för crafting-gillet bl.a. Tome var med i, som berättade lite om mitt förflutna; namnet och titeln Mistwalker, min ålder, var jag hör hemma, varför jag har väskan och så. Tony snackade lite med nån distrubitör av öl I denna staden, för att se om det kan vara intressant med något kontrakt för att vara distrubitör av vin.Vi börjar med att kolla vad Tony och Haggan gör under dagen Singwin är och smider.Haggan letar upp en shop där hon kan handla materialet för spellen \"Summon Fey\", Gilded flower worth atleast 300gp.Hon hittar till slut dvärg I stora forgen som kan skapa en åt henne. Kostnad 350gp. Hon ska fundera på det och drar så länge med Tony på resan till hans familjegård.Allt är överväxt och gården ser förfallen ut. De sparkar in dörren och det ser likadant ut inuti. Mycket växter och smådjur befinner sig I hela gården.När de kommer tillbaks så möts vi på hotellet och pratar lite. Jag ivsar upp min nya handske och de nämner lite om deras resa.Chwinga Charm, +2 till hit, 3. charges.En tacksamhetsgåva till någon som är värd den. Den kan ta hur många former som helst. Just denna som de hittade var I trä.Dagen efter smithingen går jag o Tony mot ett enchanter-ställe. Han frågar om medaljongen/bellocken de hittade och den var tyvärr inte magisk och jag känner inte heller till symbolen inuti den.Framme hos enchanter får jag veta att jag kan gå en kurs för att själv skapa essencer. Kan använda olika typer av objekt för att förvara essencer jag skapat. Det tar 5 dagar (full work week) för en essence. Alla dagar använder samtliga spellslots för varje dag. Lvl 5 för uncommon essences, lvl 11 för rare essences.Utan att förvara en essence kommer den att dispersea på en dag (12h).Kursen är en vecka (för mig). 100GP.Vi går tillbaks till Bastion Shore och pratar lite med Haggan innan vi ska på båten senare på kvällen.Haggan vill ta sig till Ranhold. Hon tror hon kan hitta sina minnen där. Men det är väldigt farligt att ta sig dit och att vara där alls. Hon frågar ifall vi vill följa med. Vi båda är med på det.Vi tar samma båt tillbaks, 2GP per person. Han åker tyvärr inte till Ranhold då han har sin resa han åker. Frågar om vi får övernatta I hans båt senare då byborna inte är så glada på oss. Det gick han med på.På morgonen har han sedan pratat med en annan skeppare som kan ta oss dit för 4GP.Han tar oss dit, men inte hem då han åker direkt tillbaks efter vi tagit oss dit.Så snart vi får staden I ryggen så blir det stor skillnad på hur havet beter sig. Mycket svårare än resan tidigare.Vi kommer fram och börjar röra oss bortåt. Vi går vidare för att komma till den enda byggnaden vi ser, The Lone Inn.När vi kommer fram öppnar vi dörren till det nedsläckta och tillsynes tomma innet. Vi går fram till bardisken och pratar lite med keepern. Han var väldigt deprimerad. Han trivs inte alls på ön och det gör ingen annan heller. De flesta dör I förtid på denna ö.Han och hans far äger Innet och lever på att fiska utöver innet.Han varnar oss för häxor I träsket. Finns ett Coven med häxor.Vi går ut och Haggan tror att det är träsket vi ska till. Vi går närmare och tar sedan en eka och ror fram I det dimmiga träsket.Haggan flera gånger om tror hon ser något som rör sig I dimman. Efter ett tag ser vi massa rundade stenar precis ovanför ytan där vi ror.Haggan fortsätter se något som rör sig då och då I dimman. Och till slut, som två stora lampor lyser det inifrån dimman och Haggan möter dens blick. Hon börjar direkt att stelna och förstenas. Försöker hjälpa henne och Tony fortsätter ro men inget hjälper. Till slut lyckas Haggan titta bort från de två gula lysena och effekten börjar avta.Vi fortsätter ro ett bra tag och vi fortsätter se de där stenarna I vattnet. Haggan har också sett ansikten nedanför ytan på stenarna sen hon började se dem. Vi inser då att det är antagligen offer för vad eller vem det än var som lyste mot oss och började förstena Haggan.Vi kommer fram till ett slut för vattnet och nu är det mer vanlig mark. Haggan stoppar ner handen I mossan och börjar sedan springa iväg. Hon säger att de kallar på henne, kallar henne hem.Jag och Tony rusar efter men vi hinner inte I samma fart som Haggan, Tony ropar att hon får vänta på oss.Vi håller ihop ett tag men sedan försvinner Haggan för oss. Vi hör henne men ljudet kommer från olika håll hela tiden och vi kan inte höra var hon är. Vi fortsätter samma riktning som vi hade.Haggan kommer till slut fram till en grotta och ser där inne en svamp som sprudlar av liv. En rödare svamp. Hon följer som ett spår av svampar som tar henne längre och längre in I grottan.Jag och Tony har helt tappat bort Haggan. Jag slänger Locate Object och försöker lokalisera Haggans stav som jag har identifierat tidigare. Men av någon anledning kan jag inte finna den alls.Vi går framåt en bit till och börjar höra en björn. Vi stannar och väntar lite. Ljudet kommer från olika håll men det hörs närmare och närmare. Rytanden och stampanden.Vi hör även en annan röst bakom, något djurisk men än något ljusare röst.Björnen kommer fram ur dimman och den är en hemsk syn. Delar av huden på den har börjat förruttna, den är övervuxen och luktar fruktansvärt illa.Den har en undead under sina tassar som försöker riva efter den, men björnen responderar med att bita av huvudet av den som är under och slänger iväg det.Den ser oss och ryter starkt mot oss.Vi går in I fight mot den. Och vi lyckas klå den.Haggan kommer vidare I grottan och hittar ett bord med en skål. Det ska vara minnen I den. Hon vet att något saknas, sand! Och börjar leta lite. Hon hittar då en hide av något slag, en som är rimlig att ha på sig. Den har björntassar på sig och fylld med mossa och annat bös som hon tar bort. Hon ser även ett bälte på bordet. Hon tar på sig det enkla plagget och även bältet.Hittar en påse med sand och häller det I skålen. Så fort sanden hamnar där I börjar den röra sig I någon form av mönster.Hon tömmer hela påsen och det ser ut som en droppe som droppar I vatten där det bildas vågor I form av ringar. Så ser det ut I sanden.Hon vet inte vad mer hon ska göra men börjar kolla runt lite till.Hon hittar lite mossa och tar med det till skålen. Hon märker då att sanden förflyttar sig. Hon börjar lägga det I skålen.Då ser jag och Tony att björnen förvandlats tillbaks till Haggan. Hon vaknar upp och hon verkar inte vetat om vad hon gjort. Vi pekar på kroppen och huvudet som ligger en bit bort. Hon svarar att hon var I en grotta precis nyss. Hon kollar lite snabbt men hör ett ljud en bit bort. En hint till att hon, och vi, behöver dra härifrån, och det fort. Vi springer för att ta oss ut ur dimman.Jag kunde under rusandet ut se en humanoid helt gjort I svamp.Hon tycker det låter konstigt och läskigt.Hon försöker minnas och ser att hon har kvar rustningen hon hittade I grottan. Vi ser den och förstår inte när hon har hunnit göra det.Haggan säger att hon för första gången kände igen sig. Hon tror hon är rätt gammal.Vi diskuterar lite kring vad som har hänt. Vi förstår inte riktigt hur allt kan ha hänt så som det gjorde.Vi måste ta och vila för dagen och letar upp en lämplig plats som är bortifrån dimman. Tillslut finner vi en ranglig stuga som kan vara lite skydd mot vind och regn.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#session"],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"Rasmus","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-21-2023-05-23.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1730964969044,"modifiedTime":1736873239742,"sourceSize":8601,"sourcePath":"02_Journal/Thalbrine - Big campaign/Session 21 - 2023-05-23.md","exportPath":"02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-21-2023-05-23.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":200,"backlinks":["02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-24-2023-06-17-lan-session-med-johan.html"],"type":"markdown"},"02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-22-2023-05-28-maskerad.html":{"title":"Session 22 - 2023-05-28 - Maskerad","icon":"","description":"Började spela omkring: 16 ish.Recap: Vi drog till Ranhold efter vi var klara på Bastion Shore för att följa Haggans spår mot hennes förflutna. Vi tog oss till något träsk och väl där hade vi lite problem med Haggan. Hon försvann och vi kunde inte hitta henne. Plötsligt möter vi en stor och riktigt schleten björn som kommer emot oss för att döda oss, men vi lyckas klå. Men vi inser snabbt att det var Haggan som var björnen. Hon påstår dock att hon inte har något minne av det och att hon var någon annan stans. Vi drog snabbt därifrån och slaggade i en stuga en bit bort.Haggan när vi vaknar önskar att vi direkt drar iväg från ön. Vi drar till Oaksdale och får tag I en båt som kör oss till udden utanför Sears Haven, var vi drar oss till Helm's Portal och sedan direkt till Capers.Vi skickas direkt in till Gideon av Harry och han berättar.Han har ett kontrakt han inte kan hålla, men han kan inte neka kontraktet på grund av vem kunden är.Vi ska infiltrera en Bal säger Gideon. Tony kommer få ett stort ok på sina axlar. Gideon säger att Tony och Haggan kommer kunna komma väl till hands.Det är en maskerad. Hans förra party som skulle haft partyt skulle ha tagit på sig andra identiteter.Vi ska till Bastion Shore igen och båt etc är fixat. Den är på Ingmouth.Nordvästra halvön, Thornbury Keep, ägs av de tre döttrarna; Äldst Valetta, Valeria och yngst Valencia.Vi ska träffa kunden I Bastion Shore, på ett Inn I Living District, nordvästra distriktet. Refererar till honom som K. The Dredger heter Innet.Säg \"Dredge the Deep, catch the rich\" till någon I distriktet så kommer de garanterat visa oss vägen.Vi ska hämta några objekt åt vår kund som han säger har stulits från honom av the Thornburys'.Tony frågar efter uppdrags-beskrivningen om amuletten han hittade med sin morbrors initialer på. Den tillhörde eventuellt en gammal utdöd cult. Havsdyrkare.Haggan frågar Gideon lite om lite minnen hon fått tillbaks. Han har inget jättebra svar. Hon frågar efter Ärkedruider, men enligt Gideon finns det nog inga kvar I världen. Haggan frågar ifall <a data-href=\"Robius\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/robius.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Robius</a> är en, varpå Gideon skrattar och säger att han må va en Druid och en ärkeidiot men inte en ärkedruid.Vi går sedan ut och Haggan ger mig och Tony 10GP var för att vi betalat åt henne på våra resor det senaste.Liten paus och sedan morgonen efter drar vi iväg.Vi kommer fram till Bastion Shore till slut och vi drar oss till nordvästra distriktet och petar på första bästa person och säger frasen, varpå han säger \"nejj de håller jag inte på med\" och sticker iväg.Vi går vidare och letar efter en med mer skepparklädsel och säger samma sak. Han svarar direkt \"jaha, följ med\". Han tar oss till en källare och säger \"Välkommen broder\".Vi går in och möts snart av en herre med en svart huva ner till näsan.&lt;&gt;Runt 175cm uppskattar Singwin att han är. \"K?\" säger Tony. Vi får \"Mycket riktigt, följ med här\" till svar och han leder oss iväg till ett eget rum. Vi sätter oss och diskuterar lite.\"Så det är detta jag har att göra med\" säger K. \"Gideon säger att ni är mästerinfiltratörer\". \"Ja\", svarar vi.\"Självsäkra är ni I alla fall, har ni varit på bal\". Vi svarar nej, Tony svarar ja.Ingen vanlig bal. De tre systrarna kommer delta på balen, Valetta, Valeria och Valencia. Valeria anordnar balen varje år. Extravagant är en underdrift och vi behöver klä oss utefter det. K ska fixa vår utstyrsel så vi passar in ordentligt.K var besök på Thornbury keep där de skrev till 3 stycken namn till på gästlistan, varav en hedersgäst, vilket passade Tony bra. Han kunde ha sina kläder han tog med sig, trots att det nog var lite under-klätt.Tony fick en mask som en Orm, Singwin en som en Raven och Haggan som en Deer.Min magiska mask passar inte jättebra, samt att masken K gav mig inte sitter asbra heller pga lite konstig form på mig.Valetta, äldsta systern, styr över familjen. Dricker inte, men röker. Kommer vara på festen. Det är hon som K tror har stulit hans tillhörigheter.Det vi ska sno tillbaks. Ett set av armor. Ser ganska simpelt ut, lite morbidt. Vi får absolut inte ta på oss rustningen. För delvis vår egen säkerhet.\nEn chestpiece gjord I patched, tanned hide\nEtt set med handskar I benig brynja\nEtt par skor I brunare, kanske lite mörkare, svart läder. Utvikta längst ut, insidan av skon är röd.\nEtt litet skrin med en pryl i. Gjort I ren silver med ett blytäcke.\nHan har en misstanke att de kan vara I tornet I keepen. För att komma dit, gå över en lång och hög bro. Finns inga fönster. Luftgluggar finns, väldigt smala.Finns ett \"Arcane Eye\".Den yngsta, Valencia, bör man vara extra vaksam för. Dricker och röker. En \"känd flört\". K tror hon är väldigt klyftig, klyftigare än vad hon ser ut. Hon gör mycket för att känna sig kraftfull och stark.Valeria kanske går att utnyttja när hon är för full. Röker inte, dricker endast. Har skrivitMan får ett pris om man senare på kvällen kan gissa vilken av systrarna är vem. Alla har samma klädsel och endast har olika masker. De är redan lika sen tidigare.Lord Thunderbrew ska komma, en stor högljudd dvärg. Han drar ofta uppmärksamhet till sig och låter ofta högst.Lady Carmilla Cordington.

Står ut som den enda inbjudna Tabaxin. Handelsman och trollkarl. Håll er undan. Säger vad han tycker om allt och alla.Lyra Greffel(?). Är en högfödd alvisk kvinna. Skitsnygg. Klär sig ganska propert men utnyttjar sina former 🥵. Endast 180år. Visare och smartare än hon bör vara. K har haft \"affär\" med henne flera gånger. Haft en lång utbildning. Väldigt kunnig inom det magiska. Det går eventuellt att få hjälp av henne med något form av utbyte.K kommer ha på sig en Råttmask. Vi får inte veta om varandra väl på plats.Haggan frågar lite om objekten men han vill inte svara, det angår endast honom. Han påminner om att vi INTE ska ta på oss dem.Delarna som vi skal hämta blev stulna på en trade-caravan när de skulle flyttas mellan hans estates, då caravanen kom aldrig fram.Vapen är tillåtet, men man får inte dra något på en annan plats än Courtyarden.Vi följer med K iväg till en Klädbutik. Han som arbetar där drar igen gardinerna och stänger butiken när vi kommit in.De tar med Haggan bak och visar en klänning de vill hon ska ha. Hon använder sin Robe för att få den så lik som möjligt, vilket hon som arbetar där tyckte om.Haggan ler för första gången på länge.Tonys kläder löste sig fort.Sedan till mig. Där de inte tycker handskarna funkar till utstyrslen, och sen passar inte kläderna de fixat till min kroppsform riktigt. Pga svans och ben.Tar av mig handskarna.De tar lite mått på mig och börjar sy om kläderna så de passar.De syr även om Tonys kläder så de passar som de skaSingwin börjar fundera på vad han ska göra med Bagge, väskan.Frågar K, och jag kan givetvis inte ha med väskan. Pratar lite med Bagge om detta och vi kommer fram till att Semil kanske kan hålla ett öga på Bagge under tiden. Griffon's Sanctuary ligger ganska nära.Vi behöver nog inte mer än 4 timmar på plats. Sedan börjar det bli väldigt rowdy och mycket fylla.Ett 80-tal gäster.Till dörrvakten får vi introducera oss som\nTony &gt; En okänd hedersgäst\nHaggan &gt; Lady Firecoat. Gift med Singwin.\nSingwin &gt; Lord Firecoat. Gift med Haggan. Låtsas var gammal som Haggan.\nAngående betalning ses vi på samma plats som idag. Vi kommer få 1000GP.Han tar fram en Ring med röd kristall på. Ring of Nondetection. Går inte spåra personen genom magi. Krävs Attunement.Vi drar till Semil och lämnar Bagge och Haggans stav.Vi funderar länge på hur vi ska gå till väga. Vi tror vi ska till att börja med låta Tony flörta med Lyra och se om hon vill hjälpa till. Jag och Haggan går runt och minglar och sedan försöker vi hålla koll på systrarna och vem som är vem.Sedan när folk börjar bli dragna får Haggan ta sig in till tornet om prylarna är där och sedan ut igen. Wildshape och Gaseous form.Lord Oakbone. Äger Oakenfield Castle. Noblest of Noble. Äger största delen av land på hela ön.Vi kommer fram och går ut ur vår vagn.Precis intill huvudbyggnaden finns en lång bro 15m upp i luften som går till ett högt torn. Det enda tornet på hela estaten.Vi tar oss in utan problem. Tony blir stoppad och får lite ord hälsat till sig från han som möter oss i dörren. \"Alla systrarna har silvriga masker, men hennes är snällast.\" och att \"Hon väntar på att få träffa dig/få prata med dig\".Vi ser mängder av olika masker. De flesta kläder är ganska lika dock.Vi hör snabbt och tydligt dvärgen som vrålar på dvärgiska och tar med två tjejer upp förbi oss. Hälsar lite på oss på dvärgiska och frågar ifall vi har träffats förut. Vi hinner inte svara innan han drar förbi oss och går in.Haggan letar lite efter något spår av nån Ward eller nåt spejjande öga eller något. Hittar inget speciellt.En kortare herre med kvinna som båda har en ank/and-mask går mot oss. Kommer fram och frågar ifall vi vill vara med på ett litet spel. Där man i tur och ordning ställer en fråga till någon i motpartens grupp, som går att svara ja eller nej på. Efter senast 5 frågor så ska man försöka gissa på vem som är bakom masken. Svarar man rätt så får vinner man. Om man får rätt på namnet vinner man 30GP från den andra.Vi funderar länge och de erbjuder sig börja. Vi gör så och låter dem börja.\n\"Har du nånsin gjort affärer över havet?\" Till Tony. - Ja.\n\"Värderar du din fru mer än dina juveler?\" Haggan till Herrn. - Hon betyder mer än allt.\n\"Har herren några familjemedlemmar här?\" Till Tony. - Nej.\n\"Är det Herr och Fru Kålsson?\" Till Herrn o frun. - Ja!\nVi vinner därmed 30GP och de undrar ifall de var så tydliga med vilka de var.\"Våra kusiner ska komma på besök\" nämner dem och håller sig sedan för munnen och ber oss inte nämna det. Sedan frågar de Tony, ifall det är ok, ifall Tony kommer utan dejt ikväll. Han smyger sig fram till hennes öra och viskar \"ja\". De diskuterar lite \"Nämen tror du det är han? Neejj det är inte säkert. Men kanske?.Pratar lite och Tony nämner om det som dörrvakten sa till honom.Ner för stora trappan kommer 3 stycken som har likadana utstyrslar.Längst fram med en *Vargmask, Mitten med en Tvättbjörnsmask, längst bak med en Rävmask**.Någon av de tre säger att balen är igång och att kvällens första dans börjar.Den dvärgen är med just nu och som han ska dansa med har masken av en Katt. Helvit klänning med tydliga former.Haggan var inte så sugen på dans och vi hoppar över det. När dansen väl börjar så blir det lite mer öppet runtomkring rummet.En kvinna med en mask av en Uggla står intill oss ensam med ett glas med vin.Hon kommer fram till oss och frågar ifall det inte blir någon dans ikväll. Jag nämner att Frugan har lite dålig rygg, men att jag gärna dansar senare.Hon säger att hon gärna ville ta en dans med Tony, den unga herren. Han accepterar och de går ut och dansar.Visar sig vara Lady Carmilla kommer Tony på medan de dansar.Tony smyger sedan iväg och kikar runt lite.Damen med Vargmasken kommer fram till oss och pratar lite. Hämtar något att dricka. Vi pratar lite kort och hon funderar på ifall jag och Haggan är någon av de andra paren men hon kan inte komma på. Jag frågar sedan ifall hon ta en liten dans vilket hon svarar ja på, dock frågar hon min \"fru\" (Haggan) om det är ok först.Vi går ut och jag leder henne på ett halvbra sätt i dansen och ställer några enkla frågor till varandra. Hon tappar ganska snabbt intresset och lämnar dansen efter en stund.Nån kvinna i björnmask kommer fram till Tony. Hon frågar ifall herrn inte är intresserad av kvinnor, då hon sett att han tackat nej till flera. De pratar lite på dvärgiska efter att han inte svarade på alviska och hon försöker få lite info ur honom. Hon berättar att han är the talk of the evening. Hon föreslår en liten gambling. Till slut godkänner han att han berättar varför han är där och hon berättar lite om anledningen till att han är där.De börjar ställa frågor till varandra och blir väldigt ärliga till slut. Hon frågar till slut \"Why are you really here?\". Tony svarar ärligt och säger att han är här för stulna items. Hon nämner att hon kanske kan hjälpa. De pratar vidare.Det kanske är de som blev stulna av en black-market merchant för ett halvår sedan säger hon.Bron är en stor ward och den känner av alla magiska items man har på sig och alla besvärjelser man har lagt på sig. Högst upp I tornet är items gömda med magi. Mycket vakter antagligen.Hennes sista fråga är \"Vad heter du?\". Tonys svar, \"Jag kommer från denna ön\" och hon nöjer sig med det svaret och lämnar sedan Tony.Tony möter en man med Koimask som börjar gå runt byggnaden med någon form av väska. Tony ropar på han och då springer han fortare iväg. Tony ropar på vakterna och ber dem kolla på han som springer iväg. Han försvinner ganska kvickt som om han försvunnit plötsligt.Haggan letar efter något intressant och titta på och ser en man som stressar ganska mycket iväg. Hon rör sig mot honom och pratar lite med honom. Frågar om vart han ska och vad han har I väskan. Han säger att han ska träffa en dam på gården mot muren. Han påstår att han hade vin I väskan.Det har gått ungefär 3 timmar på festen.--- Paus här, forts. discord kvällen efter ---Vi alla tre är samlade och funderar på vad nästa steg är. Haggan försöker lokalisera en väska som hon såg en oklar person hade på sig. Denna person hade väldigt väldigt bråttom och visar sig inte vara med på gästlistan.Vi går en bra bit bort och kommer till en plats senare där det verkar som att väskan är rakt ovanför.Jag frågar varför vi är här och Haggan säger att hon följt efter den okända killen med väskan.Haggan förvandlar sig till en liten ödla och börjar klättra upp. Tony och jag står kvar en kortis och pratar men sedan blir vi lite oroliga när en del blickar börjar komma mot oss från patrullerande vakter. Vi börjar gå tillbaks till festen.Haggan kryper en bit och börjar se två figurer som sitter och diskuterar. En av dem har en Koimask jämte sig. Hon kryper nämre och lyssnar på deras diskussion. De håller i en blå halvt genomskinlig sten-boll. Ser ut som någon kristall. De pratar om att den kanske är någon nyckel eller att nyckeln är i eller något annat och istället behövs till bollen.Båda de hon spejjar på är Alver.Hon väntar kvar och de pratar lite till och nämner till slut att de senare när vakterna lugnat sig ska ta sig till Tornet.Jag o Tony kommer in till festen och börjar diskutera systrarna lite och ganska snabbt sedan kommer en snygg dam i Kattmask och möter oss och tycker vi pratar om något intressant. Det är Lyra.Vi säger att vi vet vem av systrarna som är vem.Hon frågar vad vi vet om, vi är inte säkra på om vi vill dela med oss.Lyra svarar att hon med Vargmask är den som är fullast. Jo de säger vi bör stämma.Och hon tror den yngsta systern inte är den med tvättbjörnsmask. Vi instämmer.Hon tror inte hon vet vilka vi är, hon känner inte igen oss trots att hon alltid vet vilka alla är. Tony responderar att vi vet vem hon är och låtsas som att han får fram det genom att känna på hennes hand.Hon säger att hon är mer intresserad än att bara få veta våra namn. Hon tittar djupt i Tonys ögon och lägger handen på honom. Hon lägger en besvärjelse för att komma in i hans tankar. Singwin responderar snabbt med att skydda Tony med Owl's Wisdom genom Enhance Ability. Tony accepterar dock hennes spell och hon går in i tankarna.Hon läser något i tankarna på Tony och hon responderar i tal. Till slut säger hon att \"men då har jag lite frågor\" och hon probear längre in i hans tankar. Tony motstår detta efter en stund och spellen avslutas.Hon frågar mig vem jag är och vi skakar hand. Hon säger sitt namn och jag svarar med mitt namn. Hon säger att hon tror vi har 2 vänner till här på festen och även 5 ovänner. Hon tror att vi nog inte kommer stanna så länge till på festen heller.Hon tackar för sig och går iväg. Jag ropar efter att vi kanske ses senare!Haggan lyckas stjäla kulan när de andra två blir upptagna med en vakt som kommer. Sen smyger hon in till festen för att sätta sig vid ett bord och ta en liten rest.Jag går med henne och Tony går iväg för att leta upp Vargmasken och se om man kan utnyttja denna. Det bör vara den mellersta, Valeria.Jacob smyger in och säger att vi nog är förvirrade av namnen och att vi har tänkt lite fel. Tror snarare att han sa fel igår, då jag och linus skrev samma. Oklart o meckar till det lite.Vi byter plats på Vargmasken och Rävmasken.Tony råkar röka på lite och blir lite lätt hög. Nån yngre tjej utan mask kommer fram och pratar med honom. Hon stöter lite på han. Hon tappar intresset ganska fort.Tony stirrar sedan på Vargmasken och till slut möter hon hans blick och hon går till honom. De börjar prata lite sensuellt mot varandra och hon ställer sig närmare och närmare Tony. Smeker honom lite. Och de pratar om lite grejer. Lite om vilka de är och så. Hon säger till slut att hon tror nog Tony letar efter en annan syster.Jag och Haggan sitter ner och pratar lite. Hon skjuter sig närmare och berättar vad hon hittade.Vi diskuterar lite och jag slänger Identify på kulan.Det går bra och vi vet nu att det är en magisk nyckel. Man sätter den i ett hål. Ez pz.Det finns ett silvrigt band som delar kulan i två. Ena sidan är mer slät andra mer rugged. Jag kan förstå att det är den släta halvan ska in i \"nyckelhålet\".Det är en stor commotion som kommer uppifrån. Ett 10-tal vakter kommer ner för trapporna med en alvisk herre helt blodig och dan. Det verkar vara samma som Haggan stal ifrån och samma som Tony skickade vakterna på.Tony fortsätter leta efter Rävmasken. Hittar inte men går runt lite och kollar omkring.Han kommer sedan till oss och vi pratar lite kort om att det är dags. Vi berättar om nyckeln och vi bestämmer oss för att köra.Haggan förvandlar sig till en lite näbbmus. Jag och Tony går förbi och jag ber Haggan klättra upp på mig.Vi går sedan upp för trappen. En vakt stoppar oss och säger att vi inte får gå in i något rum vid sidan av. Vi svarar att vi bara ska till balkongen för att hålla lite bättre uppsikt.Vi tar oss upp och Haggan springer till dörren. Jag och Tony hänger mot räcket och låtsas bara hänga. Dörren är dock stängd och Haggan kommer inte in. Kommer tillbaks till mig och pekar att dörren inte går att komma igenom.Jag och Tony ställer oss vid ett bord vid väggen istället och jag försöker öppna dörren med svansen. Så snart dörren öppnas lite grann så springer Haggan in. Precis efter så öppnas en dörr en bit bort och en servitris kommer ut och ser oss och frågar om vi behöver något att dricka. Hon går fram till oss och ser att dörren är öppen och hon stänger den kvickt och säger \"Oj den ska inte vara öppen\". Frågar lite om vad vi vill ha och Tony svarar åt oss.Hon går sedan iväg och blir stoppad på vägen ner för trappan av samma vakt som stoppade oss tidigare. Han verkar fråga lite om dörren och oss, hon ser väldigt ursäktande ut. Han tittar sedan tydligt och konstant emot oss.Haggan drar vidare och försöker leta efter tornet. Hon kommer till slut fram till en bro där det finns 4 vakter, en på var hörn av bron.De två vakterna nära pratar en hel del. Delvis om inbrottsförsöket. Nämnde något om en tredje person som var med dem som bröt sig in eller nåt. Valetta hade lämnat festen för att hjälpa den tredje med någon trollformel eller något.Haggan smyger vidare över bron och kan krypa igenom springan under dörren. Springer upp för trapporna där inne och kommer till en dörr. Den behöver en vanlig nyckel, inte vår kula. Dörren ser ut att vara upplåst och Haggan blir sig själv igen och tittar in i rummet genom nyckelhålet och under dörren. Finns ingen person där inne. Hon ser ett skrin på motsatt sida av dörren hon står vid.Hon öppnar den lilla behållaren med invisibility-pulver i och häller över sig. Går sedan in genom dörren och börjar leta. Tar skrinet och lägger det i en ficka. Letar sedan efter de andra prylarna.Hon lyckas bryta upp ena kistan men hittar inget av det vi letar efter där. Hon bryter upp andra kistan och hittar inget där heller. Det hon ser är i första kistan endast en journal av något slag, nån form av loggbok. Hon tar även en fin sten och en spännande metallklump.Hon försöker leta efter en plats där hon kan stoppa in kulan. Till slut får hon krupp och bara stoppar ner kulan i en skål. Direkt när hon gör det börjar det lysa runt kulan och på kanten av skålen. En helt slät vägg en bit bort lyser och förändras och öppnas upp på samma sätt som Singwins Portable hole. Där inne ser hon ett till skrin, en hide, ett par handskar och ett par skor. Det är dem vi skulle ha. Hon tar allt.Hon öppnar ett fönster i det lilla krypinnet och gaseous formar ut och tar sig ut ur herrgården. Observera att kulan är kvar i skålen.Hon tar sig sakta ner mot skogen som är jämte och letar upp en mörk plats att stanna på. Hon ser väl där en bra bit bort ett par vakter som patrullerar utanför muren.Hon gräver ett hål och lägger ner alla prylar där. Sen börjar växa massa blomster o annat på den platsen så det ser normalt ut.Ett par vakter börjar närma sig och hon avslutar arbetet och blir gas igen i väntan på att vakterna ska lämna. Efter en stund gör dem det och hon beslutar att ta sig till slottet igen. Hon hittar ett hörn där lite folk står men ingen tittar just nu. Hon tar sig dit och blir vanlig igen. Hon går in mot mig och Tony.Vi möts i trappan och vi pratar lite oklart om hur det har gått.Jag frågar Haggan om \"Frun har gjort allt hon ville på festen\" och hon svarar \"Ja det har varit en sån Pangfest!\". Varpå några vakter en bit bort börjar fnissa lite.Vi pratar lite till och pratar med ena vakten på vägen vi tackar så mycket. Frågar lite om tävlingen om vem av systrarna som är vem och om tävlingen är avslutad eller ej. Han berättar lite då att systrarna har varit extra luriga iår, då de har låtsats spela varandra under kvällen.Vi går ut och kommer till porten. Den är stängd. Vakterna där säger att ingen får gå ut eller in just nu då något har blivit stulet. De vill kolla oss så vi inte har något på oss. De funderar lite kring min rod jag har och vill kolla med Valetta så det inte är något. De ropar hit henne och efter en stund kommer hon. Hon säger snabbt att nej det är inget av intresse och de släpper sedan iväg oss.Vi möts av vår kusk och vi får veta att vi ska träffa K igen imorgon, mid dag, när solen står högst, på samma ställe som sist.Vi funderar på hur vi ska hämta grejerna. Vi tänkte bli osynliga och gå och hämta det men pulvret som jag fick var nys-och-kvävnings-pulver. Istället åker vi närmare med vagnen och Haggan springer till platsen och hämtar prylarna och smyger sedan tillbaks.Vi åker sedan till the Bards and the Bees och sover, 8GP för natten.Dagen efter drar vi till the Dredger igen och vi pratar med K igen. Vi plockar fram grejerna vi fixat. Han är nöjd. Han tar fram en tjock säck med 100PP (1000GP). Han får tillbaks ringen också.Han nämner att Valetta verkade vara lite orolig under kvällen till och från. Hon kunde aldrig se vem det var som rotade i hennes grejer.Han sa att om vi hade mer information var han villig att betala för det också.Vi går sedan iväg till Semil och hämtar våra grejer, sen tar vi en båt till Ingmouth och går hemåt till Capers.Vi går in till Gideon och ger han pengarna, han ger tillbaks 800GP till oss att dela på. Han är inte alls lika stressad och stirrig som sist.Tony visar honom en lapp med som vi hittade/fick på ett tidigare uppdrag, står typ \"den dellen\" elle nåt. Gideon blev lite orolig.Fick en sten/kristall av Haggan. En ojämn genomskinlig sten, en Prism Stone.Den andra stenen hon hittade var en klump med magnetite.*Lady Carmilla** - Ugglemask.

Spelade från 13.Recap:Vi är i tavernan lite och efter en stund kommer Cory och möter oss.Vi pratar lite om vad vi har vart med om. Cory vill inte berätta varför hans syster Holly behövde hjälp \"Vi kan ta det en annan gång\".Haggan berättar att hon vart en ÄRKEDRUID förr. Hon berättar att hon vet hur hon dog (vilket hon inte berättat för oss som var med henne på Ranhold). Hon slogs mot en Lich. Hon slogs mot Lichen och då hörde hon en röst som sa \"om du ger mig din själ så dör lichen\", vilket hon gjorde och då dog hon. Men hon har fortfarande en själ enligt Gideon.Vi försöker komma överens om att inte hålla hemligheter. Oklart hur bra de kommer gå.Vi berättar vad som hände när Haggan var på sin hemplats och var en björn och slogs mot oss.Vi kommer fram till att vi gör vad vi vill idag. Tony vill dra och lämna ett brev till vingården.Jag ska försöka hjälpa Cory att fixa sin glaive som råkade bli lite tokig. Försökte men det gick skit, men fanns lite tid kvar så lyckades lösa det sen ändå. Tog hela dan typ.Haggan försöker ta reda på hur hon ska ta kontakt med en ärkedruid.Vi minns efter ett tag att vi träffat en för ett bra tag sedan på the <a data-href=\"Divided Wilds\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/04_places/divided-wilds/divided-wilds.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Divided Wilds</a>, <a data-href=\"Darby\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Darby</a>. Det var han vi köpte Tigerstenarna av. Hon ska försöka fixa ett brev och skicka det till <a data-href=\"Divided Wilds\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/04_places/divided-wilds/divided-wilds.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Divided Wilds</a>. Hon konverserar med en fågel men det blir inte så bra. Slutar med att fågeln är något förvirrad och Haggan drar in på Capers' igen.<br>Haggan och Cory drar dagen efter till Fang's Hut och pratar lite med <a data-href=\"Robius\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/robius.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Robius</a>. Han känner till några ärkedruider som funnits förr. Bl.a frågar Haggan om \"Hilmia\" och det namnet känner han igen som efterträdaren för (nåt namn) i Circle of the Lands på Ranhold. Han Kände inte till Darby. De pratar om lite annat.Hon tar och pratar lite med Gideon också och lyckas få han att ta med sig brevet med nästa grupp som ska till Divided Wilds. När hon ska gå ut så ber Gideon henne stänga dörren och komma in igen. Han säger \"Jag tror du har något, som du inte borde ha\". Hon blir fundersam och efter en stund säger Gideon \"Ja fast nä, du kan bortse från det. Ignorera mig\". Haggan går ut.Efter en stund börjar hon höra en röst som säger \"Samla dina vänner\". Hon letar upp oss alla och väl gjort hör hon en annan röst \"Hitta mig\". Hon blir fundersam och hon säger inget till oss andra utan bara går omkring. Till slut säger den \"Jag finns i din ägo, hitta mig\".Vi går till Haggans rum. I stammen av trädet i mitten ligger det en bok, den boken vi tänkte ge till \"K\" på förra uppdraget.\"Hur hamnade den här?\" börjar Haggan säga innan boken börjar skaka och flyger upp i luften och slår upp några sidor och sedan viskas det från en lång text på ett språk ingen förstår, men jag känner igen markeringarna som runor av Arcane. När den är klar brinner boken upp och försvinner. Finns inte ens aska kvar på golvet. Helt borta.Precis efter började det komma nån rök från golvet som drog sig till oss, den sakta drog sig in i oss och försvann i våra kroppar. Den gav oss en konstig känsla i bröstet.Vi diskuterar lite och beslutar att ta en promenix till monasteriet. När vi kommer till byn känner vi att solljuset är inte som det brukar. Det känns för starkt, för ljust.Vi kommer fram och går in. Vi tar oss till en munk som tycker att vi nog ska prata med en annan person. Vi följer med när han leder oss till henne.En äldre dam kommer vi fram till. Tabitha. Munken, Otto, säger att det kanske kan behövas en cleansing.Vi berättar om boken, att den är stulen, att den viskade hos Haggan osv.Tabitha säger att det nog var en väldigt kraftfull magiker som gjort något.Hon frågar vilken färg gasen hade, om den var tjock eller tunn osv.Röken var svart.Då hon inte vet vad det är för typ av Curse så kan hon inte specificera \"anti-curse\"-magin utan behöver köra en mer generell sådan, som är något dyrare.Försöker med Identify på mig själv men känner inget.Haggan försöker med Detect Magic och ser en Aura runt oss, känner att det är Necromancy, vilket hon berättar. Tabitha tycker inte helt om det.Tabitha ber oss flytta bordet och hon gör en liten cirkel och ber oss ställa oss där i.Hon säger att då det kommer vara en generisk anti-curse kommer hon använda Pixie Dust. Det kommer kosta 160GP, 40GP per skalle.Hon kör på men det funkade inte tyvärr. Vi känner samma sak i hjärtat och Haggan ser fortfarande en aura runt oss.Tabitha säger att vi behöver försöka ta reda på mer kring vad som orsakade detta och vad det är innan vi kan göra något åt det. Ingen kommer kunna hjälpa oss innan vi vet mer sa hon.Vi går och letar i Haggans rum men hittar inget. Det ser exakt likadant ut som innan.Vi går sen till Gideon och försöker få lite hjälp. Han frågar lite och vi svarar på allt.<br>Han ber oss ta tag i hans hand och han flyger iväg oss till <a data-href=\"Antek\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Antek</a>.Gideon knackar på och öppnar direkt. Han ropar efter Antek och han ber oss vänta en stund!Haggan skriker också efter honom och till slut kommer han ner och frågar varför vi är här.Vi förklarar igen och Antek säger att \"det är säkert väldigt mycket oklart för.., er...\"Han förklarar att det inte är boken som gjort detta utan någon har gjort detta igenom boken.<br>Antek säger att det är inte en Curse utan en Lifebinding. Han frågar Gideon vad exakt som stals. Gideon svarar och säger \"Jaeehgh.. Det kan eller kan inte ha någon koppling till '<a data-href=\"Dendallen\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Dendallen</a>'\". Antek suckar. \"Jag ber om ursäkt för vad jag behöver berätta för er.Han tar fram en kristallkula och slänger någon magi. Antek tror att Valetta Thornbury experimenterar för att försöka uppnå nån högre nivå av Nekromanti.Dendallen var en Lich för länge sedan som Gideon satte stopp för med fler personer. Han hade inga gränser, och många efterföljare som var intresserade av att nå samma sak. Han var en stor Ikon.Valetta försöker nog återuppliva honom för att lära sig mer.Dendallen kan inte dö. Hans Phylactery är tom och är därmed bunden och kan inte helt komma tillbaks till den här världen.Kan vara så att Valetta försöker fylla den så han kommer tillbaks.Antagligen så fylls Phylacteryn av våra själar. Och när den är fylld så vaknar han till liv igen och våra allas själar kommer försvinna från denna platsen.Vi rekommenderas ta oss till Dendallens gravplats.Giden ger Antek en påse med pengar. Sedan förtrollar våra guild-emblem till ankare så vi lättare håller våra själar kvar i detta planet. Sedan en till kortare besvärjelse där vi efter det får möjlighet att använda teleportation cirklar som finns på följande platser:Aarid Province:Sears Haven, Hoax Inn, Heathshire, Oaksdale.Shrivell's Reach:Parched Inn (Saxicus Saloon)Divided Wilds:The Divided InnBastion Shore:Siren's SongHelm's Bearing:Capers'Diskussion följer med Gideon med lite frågor om säkerhet och sådant.<br>Vi kan prata med <a data-href=\"Saxicus\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/saxicus.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Saxicus</a> eller som han nu heter, <a data-href=\"Irago\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Irago</a>. Gammal bekant till Gideon.Vakta tungan kring honom tydligen. Vi borde vara tydliga med att vi inte vill Lichen något.Strax norr om Bahlors forge finns ett tempel, utan dörrar, bara ett öppet tempel.Om vi gör en uppoffring där (med juveler t.ex) så kan vi få en blessing, en beskyddande gåva från guden Karat. Skyddar från solen. Resan kommer bli mycket enklare.Det är ett slutet system, det där teleportationscirklarna, nu är det uppe i 9 personer -utöver Gideon och Antek- som har tillgång till dem. Tidigare 5 utöver Gideon och Antek.Vi rekommenderas dra direkt. Tony vill träffa Mort (Röd papegoja Feathren med panterben) för att kolla lite kring Enchanting. Så vi drar till Capers' först. Kostar 500GP och tar en vecka för att uppgradera Tonys svärd.\"Man vet ju inte hur länge man lever\" - Tony Waru<br>Direkt utanför Capers' är cirkeln. Vi snabbt tar oss till <a data-href=\"Shrivell's reach\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/04_places/shrivell's-reach/shrivell's-reach.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Shrivell's reach</a> och där är vaaaaaamt.Det är en stablelady o håller koll på kamelerna utanför innet. Hon är en Lizardfolk.Vi går in igenom de konstiga dörrarna (Salongsdörrar) där det övanför dem står \"Saloon\".Ser en man sittandes vid ett bord och vi hälsar lite på han. \"Utlänningar? Hahah, välkomna!\" Han frågar om vi vill dricka något och ber snubben i baren fixa något.Snubben i baren är en enorm jätte på dryga 2 meter lång har ett gamhuvud och en stor cowboyhatt. Han häller upp 5 shots med moonshine.<br>Han den skojfriska frågar vad vi vill och jag nämner att vi söker <a data-href=\"Irago\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Irago</a>, eller <a data-href=\"Saxicus\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/saxicus.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Saxicus</a>.Den stora mannen slår igen sin bok och frågar vad vi vill.Jag säger att vi känner Gideon och frågar ifall han gör det. Han säger att Gideon är skyldig honom en själ. Vi nämner att vi är förbannade.Han börjar gå och ber oss hänga med.Han har ben av en sfinxkatt.Vi går ut och vi säger att det gäller Dendallen. Vi pratar om allt. Han är generellt lite negativ. Frågar oss en del.Han är den enda som har nyckeln att öppna \"gravplatsen\". Det är ett fängelse för hans phylactery. Det är en lång process att öppna och ta sig till phylacteryt.Hans själ och 7 andra har tidigare vart beskyddarna för den platsen, men det är endast han som fortfarande lever.Han varnar oss; \"Om ni någonsin skulle komma nära döden, han summonar en lie av ben, så måste jag skära av ert band och ge er vila som alla i Shrivells' reach\".Han tycker om vatten.Oar's Rest har kameler som vi kan köpa. Han kommer möter oss där.Vi börjar gå och det är outhärdligt trots den korta resan på 1h.Vi ser många olika raser. Kattfolk, Lizardfolk, Orangea Alver, nån feathren och humans.Alla pratar språk vi inte förstår.En man en bit bort ropar på oss på ett okänt språk och viftar mot oss. Tony tar tag i sitt svärd i skidan och vi pratar tillbaks på common.Han vill sälja massa saker till oss och väldigt övertydligt vill sälja saker. En Insight visar att han eveeeentueeeeelt vill lura oss in till en gränd och råna oss. Försöker övertala resten av gänget om detta.Han fortsätter försöka övertala oss och säger att vi kan komma till \"Snoffels Stånd\" där han säljer allt möjligt.Tony ryter tillbaks till honom och personen svarar att \"Om ni inte har vänner i staden så kan det vara bra att vakta era tungor.\" Han spottar mot Tony och tar tag i sitt svärd.Vi lyckas skicka iväg honom och vi fortsätter gå på denna vägen med mycket stånd o butiker men vi får även många blickar emot oss från många olika.Vi hittar en klädbutik där Cory och Haggan stannar medan jag och Tony drar vidare för att leta efter kameler.Jag och Tony hittar ett torg med en Oas där endast kameler går och dricker. Det finns nog en uppfödning av kameler där det finns mängder av kameler.Jag summar min lilla griffon som får hålla lite koll och direkt efter går till ett stånd i närheten av kamelhuset.Vi diskuterar med mannen som säljer kameler. Tony försöker pruta på de 50GP som han säljer kameler för och sedan de 40GP som han kan tänka sig köpa tillbaks dem för.Språket de talar kallas \"The Lizard tongue\", eller riktiga namnet \"Rakash\".Jag diskuterar lite med Tony och säger att jag kanske kan lyckas köpa 2 kameler för 2st 25GP diamanter. Jag slänger Distort Value på två av dem. Vi går sedan in och ger fram två vanliga 25gp diamanter, men det räcker inte för två. Jag tar efter detta upp de två \"uppgraderade\" diamanterna och de räcker för 2 kameler. Vi köper dem.Han berättar lite kring kamelerna. De behöver bara dricka typ var tredje månad (?) och då dricker de massor. En varm dag så kanske de orkar gå i 6 timmar innan de behöver vila.Finns farliga hundar med eld i munnen, kallas för \"Sarchaz\" och är även ett starkt själsord.Cory handlar sina nya kläder och vi möts sedan strax utanför staden.Haggan nämner att hon kan fixa vatten om vi behöver sedan.Jag frågar om det inte var så att Irago skulle möta oss här, och säger sedan högt \"Irago, vart är du? Vi skulle väl möta dig här\".Direkt då säger han \"Jo, det skulle ni\" i sin sega röst precis bakom och ovanför mig.Skrämmer mig då han plötsligt bara befann sig på plats.Kort snack innan han sakta går in mot staden. Det syns tydligt att folk som står i hans väg flyttar på sig väldigt långt för att släppa förbi honom. De håller många meters avstånd när han kommer gåendes.Vi sätter upp på kamelerna och börjar färdas mot templet där vi ska offra.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#session"],"headers":[{"heading":"Vi blir cursed","level":2,"id":"Vi_blir_cursed_0"},{"heading":"Vi kopplas på Teleportation circle systemet","level":2,"id":"Vi_kopplas_på_Teleportation_circle_systemet_0"},{"heading":"Vi tar oss till <a data-href=\"Shrivell's Reach\" href=\"Shrivell's Reach\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Shrivell's Reach</a>","level":2,"id":"Vi_tar_oss_till_[[Shrivell's_Reach]]_0"}],"links":["04_places/divided-wilds/divided-wilds.html",".html","04_places/divided-wilds/divided-wilds.html","03_npcs/robius.html",".html",".html","03_npcs/saxicus.html",".html","04_places/shrivell's-reach/shrivell's-reach.html","04_places/shrivell's-reach/shrivell's-reach.html",".html","03_npcs/saxicus.html"],"author":"Rasmus","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-23-2023-06-10.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1730964968144,"modifiedTime":1736874264637,"sourceSize":13461,"sourcePath":"02_Journal/Thalbrine - Big campaign/Session 23 - 2023-06-10.md","exportPath":"02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-23-2023-06-10.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":202,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-24-2023-06-17-lan-session-med-johan.html":{"title":"Session 24 - 2023-06-17 - LAN-session med Johan","icon":"","description":"Started Halvdags resa från Oar's Rest\nFinished Strax utanför en ruin\nEncounters Ökeninsekter och läskiga skuggmonsterBörjade spela omkring: 12ish.Johan är med!Vi tar våra två kameler och går via Hazelwood Ranch.Vi ser en del vandrande undeads på resan.Con-save pga varmt.1:a fail 9/15\n2:a Success 18/16\n3:e Success 22/17 (nat20)\n4:e fail 17/18\n5:e fail 1/19\n6:e fail 19/20Vi sätter upp camp vid dagens slut och vi får sova ostört.Nya saves dagen efter1:a success 22/15 (nat20)\n2:a success 21/16\n3:e success 18/17Efter 6 timmars resa båda dagarna ser vi palmer och kommer fram till stora stängsel. Vi når nåt hus som typ ser ut som en taverna och vi går in där efter att vi bundit fast kamelerna.Tony kollar i bardisken men ingen är där så han lägger fram lite mynt och tömmer lite ur en tunna. Är något genomskinligt men känns tunnare än vatten.Haggan kör ett dofttest i tavernan och det luktar lite fränt typ.Haggan hittar en övervåning en bit bort och det verkar vara någon som sover där inne. Vi tar sedan en short rest i tavernan bara.Vi tar ut Everice Box och Haggan fyller den med vatten och sedan stoppar tillbaks i mitt hål.Vi rider sedan vidare.Ny save:1:a Success 18/15Det har blivit mindre undeads när vi går. Väldigt få nu. Är det någon skillnad här? Vad är skillnaden?Skickar iväg min lille Pseudogriffon som får speja lite efter varelser och byggnader.Den ser en sandhög som verkar flytta på sig och jag ser den också. Berättar för resten av gänget.Högen verkar stanna 60ft bort.Cory med sin kamel tar några steg och då säger Haggan att hon såg den röra sig lite.Vi pausar en kort stund och innan vi hinner bestämma oss så kommer en stor läskig insektsgrej Den spottar nåt äckel på Cory och Tony.Det kommer en till insekt från andra sidan som attackerar min och Haggans kamel. Den ställer sig på bakbenen och Haggan trillar av.Fight beginsUnder fighten så transformeras Haggan till en brunbjörn med mycket svamp, dött skinn o sånt. Exakt samma som jag och Tony såg och slogs mot i träsket på den där ön. <a data-href=\"Session 21 - 2023-05-23\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-21-2023-05-23.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Session 21 - 2023-05-23</a>Tony har ihjäl en av dem. Jag den andra. De gör något högt klickande ljud när de dör och Pseudogriffonen ser fler sandhögar som rör sig en bit söderut.Vi springer österut och försöker rusa ifrån insekterna. Vi ser omkring ett 10-tal sandhögar som rör sig. De kommer närmare och vi vågar inte fortsätta på samma väg, så vi svänger av norrut. Många hänger fortfarande efter och en del av dem kryper upp på marken och springer istället för att gräva. Efter ett tag slänger jag Slow på hela klungan och då får vi ordentligt med försprång.Vi ser någon ruin och drar oss ditåt. Vi tar en paus och under tiden skickar jag min griffon och kollar lite om det finns fler sandhögar. Han ser många sandhögar åt alla håll på lite olika avstånd.--Pausar oss och Johan får lite speltid--Han verkar sitta ovanför oss i ruinen.Efter mer diskussion mellan oss hör vi sedan en röst \"Vilka är ni och vad gör ni här?\"Vi försöker leta upp vart rösten kommer ifrån och rösten ekar från alla håll. Jag svarar att jag tycker att du kommer ner!Han säger igen, \"Vilka är ni och varför är ni här?!\"Cory hoppar upp och får ett snitt i ansiktet som respons och hoppar ner igen.Vi svarar nu istället på frågorna med våra namn och att vi är här pga Gillet, vilket Cory inte accepterar och vi säger istället att det är pga en annan oklar anledning som vi inte tänker berätta.Gol (stavning?) heter han, en brun Kobold.Vi pratar lite.Han vill föreslå ett utbyte. Han tycker om ruiner och just den vi befinner oss i är lite klurig att ta sig in i. Han vill ha hjälp med att ta sig in i ruinen och då kan han hjälpa oss också. Han kan tänka sig dela på den ev skatten här också om vi hjälper till, utöver att han kan hjälpa oss på vår resa.Han berättar lite om vad tanken är, en gravplats och vi ska nedåt i ruinerna. Vi behöver hitta en väg ner. Han leder Tony till ett gäng stora stenar som verkar stå i vägen.--Matpaus+handling en bra stund, typ 14:40-16:40--Tony har burit bort stenarna som var ivägen och Haggan är på väg för att möta han. Hon märker av en fälla innan hon utlöser den och klarar sig precis. Gol förklarar att det är en fälla för såna han inte vill ha att göra med och pekar vägen som hon ska gå för att komma undan fällorna.Uppstår en liten diskussion mellan Tony och Haggan. Framförallt om att Tony är sur över att ingen har hjälpt till. Cory går och möter upp dem också.Jag frågar Gol hur jag vet att jag kan lita på honom att han inte kommer hugga mig i ryggen. Han föreslår att han går först, vilket känns ok.Vi går längre ner i ruinen genom öppningen Tony fixade.Hittar ingenting utan vi behöver nog ta oss än längre ner. Hittar en till väg och tar bort stenar där och sedan klättrar ner för ett till rep som vi knyter fast.Haggan fastnar vid en doft som hon känt sedan vi började klättra ner. Hon vet inte vad det är men skrapar lite på väggen och doftar och det verkar vara cementen mellan plattorna som luktar. Varför? Vad är det gjort av?Hon ser också murals för lite historia. Hon ser ödlefolk som för iväg stora led med människor och andra tunnhudade folk och använde till något. Vet inte exakt vad men de överlevde nog inte processen.Haggan säger att eventuellt kan det vara så att ruinerna är uppbyggt av människor som ödlorna tillfångatagit och \"processerat\".Spenderar närmare 3h att leta efter något intressant. Till slut efter många om och men hittar vi ett otroligt stort och djupt hål. Vi knyter ett rep och hela går åt för att nå ner till botten. Vi får ändå hoppa sen för att försöka nå repet för att komma upp igen.Vi kommer till en stor sal.På murals här ser vi nån form av mass-sacrifice, som skett. Men hur och till vad är inte så tydligt.Finns ett gäng stenkistor i ett rum vi tar oss till. En av dem sticker ut en del på hur placeringen är till skillnad från de andra. Men ingen adornation eller annat.Jag och Haggan försöker öppna graven men vi är lite klena.Cory hjälper till och vi lyckas öppna. När den öppnats någon decimeter så flyger en skugga ut och facklan släcks och vi hör bara något som viner runt i rummet.Vi tänder fackla igen och Tony Lightar sitt svärd så vi ser igen. Men skuggan är kvar och rör sig onaturligt.Haggan kollar in i graven och ser där tallrikar, muggar och annat i guld. Hon tar en grej och visar oss. \"Guld hörni!\". Då ser Haggan att skuggan närmar sig Gol lite.Vi börjar samla på oss guldet.Tony en bit bort ser en människolik figur med långa långa fingrar mörk som av en skugga. Tony slår mot den och ljuset sprids närmare och han kan se hela varelsen.Fight börjarOch vi klår den ganska snabbt. Efter en kort stund dock så hör vi att de 8 andra gravarna öppnas och likadana skuggor kommer ut ur alla.Ny fightDe kan paralyzera med sina attacker.Jag och Cory blev downade under fighten men fick hjälp.Efter fighten börjar vi länsa en de av gravarna. Gol kollar i 4 av dem, vi andra i vårt gäng delar på 4. Vi diskuterar lite kring mängden rikedomar vi alla fått och att Gol har fått bra mycket mer.Vi kommer fram till att vi delar \"jämt\" (tvek om Gol delade på hela sin mängd). Men vi delade på det.Vi tar oss upp utan större problem och det är kvällning. Vi sätter upp camp för att vila upp oss för en längre resa imorgon.Innan vi ska sova så hör vi ett rasslande av något slag. Ett dovt ljud.Morgonen därpå ser vi att alla sandhögar är kvar.Gol säger till oss att vi behöver lämna kamelerna, pga ljud och annat.Han säger att de inte kan lära sig metoden som krävs för att ta sig över öknen.Cory går till kamelerna, klappar om dem och lossar dem så de är fria.Vi ska sedan ta oss iväg och Gol visar oss hur man tar sig förbi alla läskiga monster i öknen. Men tyvärr var alla inte så bra på att följa hans steg utan de gjorde för mycket ljud ifrån sig.Han körde istället på plan B och gick o stack kamelerna i baken så de stack iväg och drar åt sig alla monster och sedan springer han i full fart iväg åt andra hållet.Everice Box Command word: \"Avaa\"/\"Havaa\"","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#session"],"headers":[],"links":["02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-21-2023-05-23.html"],"author":"Rasmus","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-24-2023-06-17-lan-session-med-johan.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1730964968313,"modifiedTime":1736873075929,"sourceSize":8751,"sourcePath":"02_Journal/Thalbrine - Big campaign/Session 24 - 2023-06-17 - LAN-session med Johan.md","exportPath":"02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-24-2023-06-17-lan-session-med-johan.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":203,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-25-2023-06-20-lizardpeople-in-the-desert.html":{"title":"Session 25 - 2023-06-20 - Lizardpeople in the Desert","icon":"","description":"Började spela omkring: 17:40Recap: Vi drog iväg från Oar's Rest först mot Hazelwood Ranch och sedan fortsatt nordöst. På vägen möts vi av mängder av stora insekter som tvingar oss norrut där vi till slut hittar en ruin. Vi träffar där Gol (Johan), en Kobold som vi hjälpte hitta skatter i ruinen i gengäld att han ska hjälpa oss ta oss till Shrinen.Vi fortsätter springa iväg österut, ish, mot Bahlor's Forge och konverserar lite på vägen.Nya rolls1:a 3/152:a 6/163:e 16/174:e 20/18Går vidare och efter ett tag ser vi ett rökmoln, det ser ut som att någon har slagit upp camp. Jag och Haggan har fått ganska såriga och brännskadade tassar/fötter och hon har helat mina och sina egna.Vi kommer närmre och ser att det är Lizardfolk som bor där.När vi går förbi ropar de mot oss på Rakesh och bara Gol verkar förstå då de konverserar lite. Gol säger att de vill prata med oss och vi går med på de. Han frågar om de kan prata common. Jag ropar att vi inte förstår dem.Vi går fram och ser tydliga tecken på att de är jägare. De har stora ödlor med sadlar på, vid sidan av.Han säger att de försökte gå förbi byn strax norröver häromdagen men de kom inte förbi utan var tvungna att slå camp här.På Rakesh (som Gol förstår) säger han att byn norröver har blivit omhändertagen av en coven med hags som har summonat en spirit som har kontroll över platsen runt byn. Om ni skulle rensa byn och bli av med anden kan ni i gengäld få två av våra rid-ödlor, då vi har två över efter att två av våra jägare dött.Det låter bra och vi funderar lite.Ödlorna är snabbare att resa med än kamelerna, OM vi reser över sanddynorna. Dock behöver ödlorna ganska mycket mer foder och även ev annat foder.Tony kommer på att andar generellt är bundna till ett objekt eller en varelse.Vi tar en liten shortrest. Jag tar fram kylboxen som är fylld med vatten och jag tillsammans med haggan stoppar ner fötterna där för att kyla ner oss lite.Gol tjuvlyssnar lite på dem när vi vilar, han går även ut och lyssnar på de andra tälten också.En lizard möter oss efter en stund. Tony försöker övertala han att vi behöver backup och hjälp av dem. Han går till slut med på det och skickar med två scouter som hjälper lite. Han frågar sedan när vi tänkte ta tag i det och vi tänker nog gå direkt.Vi säger sedan att Gol INTE får röra något guld innan vi är klara med allt vi ska göra. Han blir lite osäker men försöker göra Tony glad och säger att han inte ska ta något guld.Vi möts kort därefter av ett par med välklädda lizard-scouter och vi börjar gå.Vi kommer fram till utkanten efter en liten stund och börjar strax innan byn se torkat blod i sanden runt omkring.Funderar lite kring saker och ting innan vi går in. Jag lägger Detect Magic från Bagge och snart går vi in.Det är en väldigt öppen planlösning på byn, man kan komma från vilket håll man vill i stort sätt.Haggan ser att blodet som vi hittar i sanden måste ha blivit spilld under dagtid, inte nattetid.Vi börjar smyga mha Haggans Pass without trace mot stora mittenhuset.På vägen kollar jag in i de små husen vi går förbi ifall det finns någon aura eller nåt som jag kan se eller känna. Inget av de vanliga husen visar något tecken alls.Lizardsen har tagit sig upp på ett hustak med laddade spjut i hand.Väl inne i stora huset känner jag en Faint Aura av Abjuration magic som ligger över marken i huset, kändes även lite strax utanför huset också.Detta är första huset med blod i. Ett gäng papperssrullar ligger utspridda på golvet och ser inte placerade ut, utan snarare tappade. Bord och stolar är runtkastade.De andra 4 försökte vända på ett bord och jag kände en trollformel samtidigt som skedde från taket. Jag ropade akta och de tappade bordet som gjorde en spricka i golvet, som försvann direkt och nu går det inte längre se sprickan.Skickade ut mini-griffon och den ser att på taket finns en Lizard som ser ut exakt som de som hängde med oss. Berättar det för partyt.Jag ber Cory och/eller Gol att hänga med ut och jag ber dem ta sig upp. De tar sig upp men de ser inget där uppe. Jag skickar upp Mini-Griffon men Lizarden är borta.Mini-Griffon flyger upp i luften och försöker se någon lizard. Ser våra två scouter på ett tak en bit bort.Vi går in igen och vi försöker komma på hur vi blir av med magin här. Efter en stund känner jag att Detect Magic är på väg bort och samtidigt slängs en magi till ovanför oss och jag börjar bli helt vimsig. Huset börjar snurra, väggarna mjuknar och förflyttar sig, alla utgångar försvinner. Till slut kommer jag ut ur transen och ser att Tony också verkar lite vimsig.Gol gick aldrig in utan följde efter en Lizard han såg som springa iväg. Han kom ifatt den när den började klättra upp för ett hus där våra två scouter befinner sig. Gol slänger kniv på den och den faller ner. Då försvinner illusionen och Gol ser att det inte är en Lizard. Det är en Hag. Gol har ihjäl den.Han ser en till Lizard springa iväg mellan ett par hus en bit bort och han riktar våra Scouter ditåt och de drar på en gång. Han springer efter och hittar en av våra scouter död och blodig i ett hus. Den andra är borta. Han hör nån form av chanting från mitten av towns square.Vi andra försöker få Tony att vakna men det går väldigt dåligt.Vi hör någon form av chanting utanför huset och vi går ut och lämnar Tony. Jag lägger Detect Magic igen. Vi ser på mitten av gatan, ett Lizard huvud, färskt.Jag känner någon nära mig och ser fotspår som går in i huset. Jag skjuter en Eldritch Blast som träffar och vi ser nu en Hag rusa in i huset. Jag försöker igen men missar.Vi följer efter och vi ser henne lägga sig mitt I rummet på golvet med en huvudlös Lizardkropp och börjar hugga I den med en kniv.Vi hinner inte stoppa den och kroppen försvinner och fram ur ett hål där kroppen låg formas en stor stor kropp utifrån mängder av andra kroppsdelar, Zombieclot. Den fyller hela rummet upp till taket på 5m.------Combat begins------Vi pangade dem och lyckades döda en sista hag och en Zombieclot som den summade.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#session"],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"Rasmus","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-25-2023-06-20-lizardpeople-in-the-desert.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1730964970822,"modifiedTime":1736873062092,"sourceSize":7007,"sourcePath":"02_Journal/Thalbrine - Big campaign/Session 25 - 2023-06-20 - Lizardpeople in the Desert.md","exportPath":"02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-25-2023-06-20-lizardpeople-in-the-desert.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":204,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-26-2023-07-17-johan-inte-med,-gol-spelas-av-jacob.html":{"title":"Session 26 - 2023-07-17 - Johan inte med, Gol spelas av Jacob","icon":"","description":"Började spela omkring: 17:50. (käk o så först, hos Razz vid 17).Recap:Fighten är över.Vi börjar kolla ner i hålet där det verkar vara en källare, det var därifrån de stora monstret kom ifrån.Haggan och Cory hoppar ner i hålet. De hittar något men förstår inte vad det är och de ber mig kolla. Inget jag känner igen heller och bagge har inte heller koll, men han ser att det inte är Arcanerunor iaf.Vi ropar på Tony så får han kolla ifall han känner igen det.Jag kopierar lite av dem genom att lägga ett papper på och skrapa med penna ovanpå.Vi visar Tony och han säger att det är blodsmagi. Inget trevligt. Han vet inte vad det betyder dock.Han ger mig halsbandet att kolla på och jag identifierar det som en naturlig kristall som kan användas för att \"syntethizea\" essencer. Om man vet hur man gör så kan man spara en essence i den. Den är just nu fylld med en primal essence.Jag kopierar båda så de finns. Diskuterar lite kring om vi ska använda dem runorna/magicirklarna som finns här.Vi förstör markeringarna som finns här nere och sedan tar vi oss upp.Vi tänker nog att vi ska dra oss iväg, då vi känner oss klara, Gol tycker det i alla fall säger han och börjar gå iväg.Cory är lite osäker och jag känner lite likadant. Jag känner att jag vill kolla mer så jag kör Blink igen men hittar inget. Det borde vara lugnt.Efter det drar jag mig mot Gol och de andra med tillbaks mot lizard-campet.Vi kommer fram och Gol börjar prata med dem på Rakash.Efter en stund så säger han att de vill kolla i byn innan de ger oss våra mounts. Det är givetvis ok och vi tar en short rest medan de packar ner sina grejer.Väl tillbaks i byn ser vi ganska tydligt de illa tilltygade liken i mitten av torget.Gol pratar mer med dem och de var nöjda nu så de ger oss tyglarna till två lizardmounts.Tony har problem med att tygla den och det går bättre efter en stund.Cory vill gärna veta hur de vill bli ridna på på rätt sätt. Haggan börjar prata med dem mha Speak with Animals. Efter en stund börjar de springa iväg och vi frågar vad som händer. Haggan säger då att de var hungriga och ska jaga efter lite mat.Vi stannar kvar och äter upp vår frukost så länge.Efter över en timme så tröttnar vi lite och börjar packa ihop. Jag summar fram min lilla griffon som får spejja lite.De kommer fram tillslut och vi fortsätter resan. Lika varmt som tidigare och lika jobbigt. Vi möter lite olika folk på resan men man får bara en vinkning typ.Vi fortsätter bara åka vidare i värmen.Vi kommer fram till en skylt där det står Bahlor's Forge, på common. Första gången det står något inte bara på Rakesh.Gol tycker inte vi ska dra oss upp till Bahlor. Han tycker han är ett rövhål typ och finns ingen anledning att ta sig dit.Vi diskuterar lite kring om vi ska upp dit eller inte och Gol hotar till slut med att lämna oss. Så jag föreslår att vi INTE lämnar Gol utan hänger på honom då det var han som skulle visa oss vägen till templet.Bahlor är en före detta gladiator. Ett hett temperament och en hetare forge. De som kan ta sig dit är de som på nåt sätt känner honom eller har något till sitt namn.Övrigt folk som brukar ta sig dit är folk som vill stjäla hans mästerverk han smider. Marken upp till forgen kanske är fortrollad så att inte trespassers bara kan gå upp obemärkt.Vi drar vidare. Gol säger att han snart kommer lämna oss, då det inte är så lång resa kvar. Vi stöter på mängder av fler resande denna biten av resan.Vi kommer fram och det är ett stort tempel med ett kupolliknande tak. Vi ser solstrålar lysa där inne.Väldigt mycket folk befinner sig utanför. Även munkar i långa robes står utanför. Alla ser väldigt tunna och smala ut. Lite palmer o sånt finns runtomkring också.Väldigt långa trappsteg, inte höga utan bara djupa o långa när vi börjar gå uppåt.Vi möter en vitskäggig mörkhyad herre högst uppe på trapporna. Han ropar något på något språk vi inte förstår och vi svarar att vi inte kan Rakash.Då säger han \"Välkomna, välkomna. Det syns att ni är väldigt långt komna. Välkomna in till Karats tempel.\"Han följer med oss in i templet och leder vägen. Håller händerna bakom ryggen när han går. \"För att gå in i Karats tempel, får ni offra upp era vapen\". Tony-\"Får man tillbaks dem sen elle?\" \"Ja, när ni kommer ut ur templet\".Då börjar vi lägga ner, Tony börjar ner med svärd o Haggan sin stav och kniv. Jag lägger min rod och Cory sin glaive.Han går vidare och säger \"Det är för eran egen skull som ni lämnar ALLA era vapen\".Gol hängde med in och lämnar också sina vapen, 8 kastknivar.Vi går vidare efter munken som lett oss hittills. Vi ser inne där en OTROLIG mängd med loot ligga. Tusentals med GP i vapen, tackor, amuletter och allt möjligt.Vi ska göra en uppoffring säger munken. Vad den är värd är upp till oss själva. Karat ger oss en gåva utefter vad vi offrar.Vi offrar alla lite olika.Tony en gammal gammal vinflaska med okänt värde. Starkt emotionellt värde för Tony dock.Haggan offrar en fin juvel/sten för 50GP.Cory offrar med en assortment av prylar från tomben 50GPJag offrar 4st 25GP diamanter.Vi går fram till altaret och offrar våra prylar. Sitter nån vid altaret och ber lite med armar uppåt och talar i tungor o allt möjligt.Haggan går fram och sätter sig på knä också och får nån form av uppenbarelse.Efter det kommer hon till oss och säger att \"det kan vara bra att be en kort bön kanske, det verkar alla andra göra i alla fall\". Vilket är lite lurigt, hur kan hon ha hört det och hur kan hon ha förstått vad de sagt?Gol säger att han inte brukar be, han bara lämnar sina grejer o drar.Haggan går sen fram till munken som ledde oss in tidigare och pratar lite kring vad hon upplevdde.Sedan går hon, munken vi tidigare träffat och en till munk iväg en stund.Under tiden har vi bett o offrat o så. Efter en stund kommer Haggan tillbaks men går raka vägen förbi oss och till en man som sitter på golvet med pannan i backen. Cory smyger sig med henne.Hon kommer tillbaks och fick något hon vill att jag ska kolla på. Hon ville dock prata med fler folk här inne som hon kanske kan hjälpa. Hon går mot dem men då står det redan någon och pratar med dem, så hon kommer tillbaks.Sedan går vi utåt.Vi hämtar våra vapen som ligger i sanden. Det vart bara att stoppa ner handen där i o grabba tag så fick man sitt vapen.Vid våra fordon står <a data-href=\"Sol\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Sol</a> (stavning?) som Haggan snackade med tidigare. En Yuan-Ti. Han har sin sabel i handen med klingan mot andra handflatan.Vi berättar om byn som vi var i där Hagsen var och använde blodmagi tidigare. Vi visar symbolerna för Sol.Han frågar lite om dem och vi säger att det är Tony som vet mest, men han vet inte jättemycket heller. Han vet att det är blodmagi. Sol frågar \"hur?\". Tony svarar med att ta av sig sin handske och visa märket han har där.Sol svarar med att skära sig i handflatan och droppa blod på Tonys märke.\"Du har mycket att lära\" säger Sol. Tony svarar \"Är du som jag?\".Sol säger \"DU, är som jag\".Han skär sig i handen en gång till och visar en specifik rörelse ut över sanden och visar Tony hur han ska göra. Tony fattar efter en stund och sen visar Sol genom att slänga en bloodcurse på Tony. Sen gör Tony det på Sol, och sen Sol en gång till på Tony.Tony får lära sig lite nya bloodcurse-grejs.Sol pratar lite mer med oss. Han frågar lite om dem. Om någon av dem överlevde så kanske de kommer va efter oss. \"The Shade Blight coven\" tillhör dem antagligen.Om vi träffar på fler Haggor, döda dem. Annars kanske de skickar en demon efter oss. Då får vi inte stanna upp.Han tror vi kommer klara oss dock, då vi fixade 2 haggor och en zombieclot själva.Han tackar sedan för allt och går iväg. Han summonar en stor katt av sand och rider vidare på.Vi käbblar lite om vart vi ska. Tony kommer tillslut på hur det var. Vi kan inte hitta platsen själva. Men det var någonstans i the Ethereal Desert.Gol tackar för sig också och drar iväg västerut på egna uppdrag. Vi kanske möts igen.Vi drar norrut och reser en dag och känner inte att vi storknar längre. Vi orkar med att resa utan att dö av värmen.Över sanddynorna när vi har packat camp och är redo för att sova, ser vi något en bra bit bort. Det är Irago. Han kommer fram till vårt camp och väntar där. Vi pratar lite.\"Ta och vila upp er nu. Det är en stor dag imorgon. Vi har mycket stora jobb att göra imorgon.\"Morgonen efter säger Irago att vi behöver ta oss till en plats.\"Vi har arbete att göra\".Han drar medan vi äter lite frukost.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#session"],"headers":[{"heading":"<em>--- Level up to 6 ---</em> ","level":4,"id":"*---_Level_up_to_6_---*_#levelup_0"}],"links":[".html","?query=tag:levelup"],"author":"Rasmus","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-26-2023-07-17-johan-inte-med,-gol-spelas-av-jacob.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1730964968656,"modifiedTime":1736874257048,"sourceSize":9696,"sourcePath":"02_Journal/Thalbrine - Big campaign/Session 26 - 2023-07-17 - Johan inte med, Gol spelas av Jacob.md","exportPath":"02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-26-2023-07-17-johan-inte-med,-gol-spelas-av-jacob.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":205,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-27-2023-07-24.html":{"title":"Session 27 - 2023-07-24","icon":"","description":"Mat runt 12:30, började spela omkring: 13:40, hos migVi går och möter <a data-href=\"Irago\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Irago</a> och pratar lite.

Ni kan gå och göra vad ni vill. Jag går till The Greyhound\" och så går han.Vi kommer fram till att vi ska försöka leta upp en smed åt Tony som gärna vill ha lite järn-eller silver-pulver.Vi börjar gå omkring och Tony ropar efter folk som går ifall någon vet vart den finns en smedja. Ingen svarar utan bara tittar snett på oss.Vi går in i en läderbutik typ och Tony försöker kommunicera med personen bakom kassan men han responderar inte alls. Han svarar en gång på Rakesh men när vi fortsätter prata common så vänder han sig om bara.Vi går vidare och då viskar Bagge till mig. Jag får ett brev och där står det.\nBag Quest 5Visar det för Tony och han vill bara kolla sitt pulver först. Sen letar vi upp gubben.Tony går in till smeden. Den är kall och har nog inte vart igång på ett tag.Tony kommer ut igen efter 30 minuter. Han hade ingen bra förklaring till varför han tog sån tid på sig.<br>\"Tony, frågade du om han visste vart <a data-href=\"Borgha\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Borgha</a> håller hus?\"\"Nää\" - Tony.\"nehe. Det hade vart bra kanske, vi vet ju inte vart han bor\" - SingwinJag går till smeden igen och knackar på och han ger en ganska ok beskrivning på vart gubben bor. Västerut en bit och sen efter en stund ska man nog kunna se en lite hydda. Jag tackar för mig och vi följer hans beskrivning.Dock hittar vi inte någon hydda där. Cory rider iväg och letar från lite andra håll och till slut hittar han en hydda och vi drar oss dit.Innan vi kommer fram så öppnas dörrn och en kort ödle-creature kommer ut\"Det finns en stor stor 'Bessy', hon heter Bessy. Är mycket större än en kamel och en ohygglig best. Och den behöver jag\"\"Hade vart bra om vi kunde hålla Bessy ifrån Mar-Dakesh, hon kommer närmare för varje år som går. Hon är inte en insekt utan något med ett hårt skal. En gammal ärkerival. En exotisk varelse som inte hör hemma här, men har anpassat sig till miljön och blivit en sandkrabba. Den är en enorm havskrabba och på nåt sätt lyckats anpassa sig till att leva här.\"\"Hon tog en de av mig för länge sedan, och jag har haft svårt med balansen ända sen dess\"Tony: \"Men växer svansar inte ut igen på ödlefolk, för du är väl ödleman?\"\"Nä usch det tycker jag inte om att bli kallad. Ser du inte min majestätiska form, jag är en drake\"\"Vad är kronan på denna krabba?\" - Singwin\"Det sitter vid magsäcken, ovanför magsäcken bakom vänster lunga. Det ser ut som en säck men har ett mörkt hårt skal. Den är formbar men ser ut som kansken av en mörk stenvägg. Ni bör känna igen den när ni ser den!\"Haggan: \"Hur slåss vi mot den här då? Något som är mer effektivt mot den?\"\"Nej men kom in vi kan inte stå här ute. Kom in och sitt istället\"\"Sätt er I soffan\", Soffan visade sig vara en träbänk. Det är skitigt och skräpigt överallt.\"Ni förstår jag behöver den för min nästa trollformel\"\"Var är magin då?\"\"Jaha! Något som kan bidra till framtiden och rädda de stackarna I byn\"\"Om ni inte kan identifiera kronan så får ni leda mig till kroppen så kan jag göra mitt verk på den\".Vi kan använda en burk med brun sörja för att locka på Bessy.\"Gå ut en kilometer och häll ut sörjan på marken I breda linjer, några meter långt. Sen bör Bessy komma, det är oemotståndligt för Bessy\"Vi diskuterar en del utanför ifall vi ens ska göra detta. Vi tänker att vi ens ska göra det. Vi kommer fram till att göra det och börjar rida ut.Vi häller ut sörjan och sätter oss en bit bort och väntar.Diskuterar strategi ett tag medan vi väntar. Vi ska försöka göra Bessy slö eller hålla fast henne. Sen fokusera på fästena till benen och till klorna. Kanske slå av klorna eller nåt.Efter en timme så ser Haggan att det rört sig I sanden lite. Vi fortsätter avvakta.Kort senare ser Tony en zombie som snubblar fram och den går rätt över sörjan vi hällt ut, exakt där Haggan såg det röra på sig.Jag skjuter en Eldritch Blast på zombien. Den träffar och zombien snubblar nedåt lite. Då rör det sig väldigt mycket I sanden och sen kommer en klo upp ur sanden och greppar tag I zombien och slänger iväg den.Vi andra börjar rusa fram och krabban sakta börjar röra sig, men vi ser den inte.Jag slänger slow vid krabban. Vi ser inte att den rör sig. Efter ett par rundor så kommer ett par zombies och klättrar på krabban och några runt om.Vi dödar zombiesarna. När den sista dör så hör vi någon chanting och ser en Hagga kliva upp på krabbans lik och krabban börjar lysa av rött ljus och röra sig igen. Den ställer sig upp och sen börjar den krypa ner I sanden. Den är på väg att försvinna. Vi börjar slå lite på the Hag som stod på.Vi försökte hålla den kvar men det gick inte. Den stack. Tony, Cory och Haggan följde efter krabban medan jag stack till Borgha. Berättar vad som hänt till han och han tycker det är lite problematiskt att Bessy är zombiefierad nu. Framförallt för stadens skull.Han önskar att vi stannar I staden ett tag och vakar över den så att de har skydd från Bessy och Haggor. Jag berättar att vi inte har så lång tid kvar då vi har en förbannelse över oss. Han erbjuder sig att ta på sig sin kappa och hjälpa oss han sträcker ut handen och trollar fram något osynligt, som blir synligt och visar sig vara en brun långsmal hatt som han tar på sig<br>Jag säger att jag behöver prata med <a data-href=\"Irago\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Irago</a>/Saxicus först så vi vet att vi har tid för att stanna några dagar. Han erbjuder sig även mer belöning om vi hjälper honom med detta. Han erbjuder vägledning som extra belöning.Jag frågar ifall han har någon helande magi. Det har han inte men han har något annat som kan hjälpa. Han ger mig en flaska som han säger är mot smärtan och jag dricker den. Jag teleporterar en bit bort och där jag stod så glimmrar det I luften.Han berättar en historia från en bok. Den handlar om en jakt. Den slutar ganska liknande som vår jakt. Med ett mål som har flytt ifrån oss, men den säger även att trots det så är man säker från att det man jagade inte kommer komma tillbaks.Frågar ifall han kan magin \"Sending\". Ja säger han, hurså? \"Kan du be mina kumpaner att komma tillbaks?\"Det gör han.Till slut en kvart senare kommer de andra tillbaks.\"Om ni hjälper mig kommer jag ge er en till belöning, jag kommer vägleda er. Ni kan få svar på vägar ni kan ta. En mycket mycket kraftfull person kommer vi få träffa\"Fortsatt oklart snack ett tag med alla.På vägen tillbaks så sliter han fram sina vingar från ryggen och han flygger in till stan.<br>Han vill hålla sig på lite avstånd från <a data-href=\"Irago\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Irago</a> till att börja med.Vi går till Innet The Greyhound och ser ganska mycket folk där inne. Dörrarna in till innet är lika konstiga dörrar som på Saxicus Saloon.<br>Jag ser <a data-href=\"Irago\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Irago</a> och går fram till honom. \"Välkommen, slå dig ner\" säger <a data-href=\"Irago\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Irago</a>.En människa sitter jämte honom Hemar.<br><a data-href=\"Irago\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Irago</a> säger att vi ska stanna någon timme och sen ska han iväg norrut. Han önskar vi ska vakta utkanten av stan under tiden.Jag berättar vart vi har varit och vad som hänt. Han blir förvånad när jag nämner att vi träffat en Hag. \"Har ni på de här fåtal timmarna hunnit träffa på en Hag...?\"<br>Berättar om krabban och det andra också och <a data-href=\"Irago\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Irago</a> svar är \"Jaha. Det är inte bra, det är ett problem\"\"Till kvällen ska ni söka upp en man som bor I utkanten av stan. En välklädd herre, en alv. Som har synts längsmed utkanten den senaste månaden enligt invånarna.Jag vill att ni söker upp mannen och tar reda på vem han är.\"\"Och om inget händer innan imorgon förmiddag så går vi norrut och tar saken I egna händer. När ni söker, ta hjälp av Hemar här, han kan hjälpa er.\"<br>Vi tar en shortrest och när vi är klara så hänger vi med <a data-href=\"Irago\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Irago</a> ut.<br>Vi stationeras på norra utkanten av stan och ska hålla vakt. Om The Order of Wim kommer så har vi inte någon chans mot dem. <a data-href=\"Irago\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Irago</a> går en bit sen försvinner han I ett moln av fjädrar.Då kommer Brogha och möter upp oss och frågar lite hur det går. Krabban verkar vara åt väst-sydväst när Tony pekar och Cory tolkar pekningen. Vi funderar på hur vi ska ställa oss.Frågar Brogha lite om de där teet jag fick, om det går att kontrollera. Han säger nae, det går inte tyvärr, man vet inte vad som händer.Som svar på det så ger han mig det andra starkare teet och vi alla dricker av den.Singwin och Tony:\nFör resten av dagen +2 Dex Abilitychecks, savingthrows, attacks, damage rolls.\nCory fick samma för StrengthHaggan fick tillbaks spellslots.<br>Inget hände under eftermiddagen. Till slut kommer <a data-href=\"Irago\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Irago</a> tillbaks.\"Vi ehhh får vänta till sent. Jag har hittat dem och mycket riktigt är en styrka på väg hit med 5 stycken och dem har nog plan att - så vitt jag kan se på dem - berätta för staden vad de tänkt göra. Och om folk gör motstånd och inte lämnar staden så lär de döda dem.\"\"Nu vill jag att ni går tillbaks till Hemar. Jag kallar på er om jag behöver er. Ni får vara här vid midnatt, då kommer de nog ha kommit hit\"Vi klättrar ner och börjar gå mot Innet och mot Hemar igen.Vi går in och ser Hemar. Går fram och pratar lite.\"det är bara ett fåtal här som har sett till honom. En herre som faktiskt har pratat om det, han är lite svårtalad, kanske får skaffa någon som får översätta. Men så ni vet, de andra som har kommit I kontakt med alven har setts till mindre och mindre om dagarna.\"Han går till en karta och pekar ut vart den där mannen bor, långt söderut I ett hus. Han är en Lizard, vid namn av Rauro.Vi går och letar efter huset. Det är becksvart där inne och dörren står på glänt. Vi hör en röst som väldigt svagt försöker säga något. Vi ser blodspår där inne.Vi följer blodet och hittar till slut en mer eller mindre ihjälslagen kropp av en lizardfolk. Jag använder Spare the Dying och hoppas det hjälper lite.\"Skraa, skraa\". \"Skraan!\" Han säger lite mer oklara ord. Vi frågar Brogha vad det betyder och han säger att de senaste betyder \"tack\".Brogha ger något mer till han som ligger på marken. Det är Rauro som ligger där.Cory ser en böld på sin kropp där han tidigare blev träffad av en crossbowbolt.Han har blivit sjuk I Blue Rot. Han tappade 4 I charisma och I constitution.Haggan tar en titt och försöker förstå. Hon tror att han ska vila bort det. Och bölderna får absolut inte spricka.Diskuterar lite.Jag frågar vem som gjorde detta mot han. Han svarar på Rakash och Brogha pratar med honom en stund innan han översätter. Efter en stund ställer han sig upp och pratar med oss. \"Han påstår att det inte alls är en alv vi söker. Han säger att I förtvivlan om att deras stad ska försvinna så har många vänt sig till en mörk entitet.\"\"Något allvarligt kokar under ytan. FÖLJ MED!\" säger Brogha.Han leder oss till en gränd och tittar upp mot ett högre hus. Ligger precis I södra utkanten. Vi provar att öppna dörren. Tony sparkar upp dörren.Direkt när vi öppnar dörren och kommer in ser vi mängder av spillt stearin och aska som svävar runt I luften. Väldigt varmt där inne. Det är undanröjt möbler. I första rummet är det tomt.Haggan hör någon på övervåningen och vi så pringer upp.När vi kommer upp ser vi människor från staden som sitter I en cirkel och I mitten en alv I fina kläder. En extremt vacker alvman, inte gammal men vuxen.Natten har börjat falla.Alven snackar på Rakash och Borgha översätter att \"Ge mig ert blod, gör mig fulländad\". Alla som sitter runt han skär halsen av sig. Jag och Tony skjuter men han stoppar oss endast men hand I luften \"Hahaha, det är försent. Det var över redan för en vecka sedan\"Jag slänger Dispel magic på hans vägg och sen Thunderstep in precis bakom honom. Tony hugger honom och Haggan skickar en blixt från himlen på honom.Men hans respons är att vända sig om, ta ur svärdet ur ryggen och han börjar växa. Större och större. Ett par vingar kommer ut ur hans rygg.Han tittar mot Tony och säger \"Hahahha, du borde spara dina krafter till finalen\". Sen tar han några vingtag iväg.<br>Jag ber Borgha slänga en Sending med varning om vad som hänt till <a data-href=\"Irago\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Irago</a>, vilket han gör. <a data-href=\"Irago\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Irago</a> svarar \"Jag skyndar mig\".Vi försöker fundera lite vad vi ska göra. Borgha säger att vi måste få bort alla invånare från staden. Cory hoppar ut för balkongen. Borgha trollar fram en dörr som leder direkt till T-korset.Vi kommer fram dit. Vi hör Alv/demonens skratt igen. Tony känner att krabban är nära och på väg.Vi ser även att norrifrån kommer en varelse på en tiger av sand. Den hoppar av och tigern försvinner ner I sanden. Varelsen har en lejonman och lite annat.Från alla tre håll kommer det fiender; Krabban + Haggan från ena hållet, Demonen från ett annat och Leoninen från en tredje.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#session"],"headers":[{"heading":"<em>---Combat igång---</em>","level":4,"id":"*---Combat_igång---*_0"}],"links":[".html","04_places/shrivell's-reach/mar-dekesh.html",".html",".html","04_places/shrivell's-reach/shrivell's-reach.html",".html",".html","04_places/shrivell's-reach/mar-dekesh.html","04_places/shrivell's-reach/mar-dekesh.html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html"],"author":"Rasmus","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-27-2023-07-24.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":["05_quests/bag-quests/bag-quest-5.md"],"createdTime":1730964968473,"modifiedTime":1736873000373,"sourceSize":14413,"sourcePath":"02_Journal/Thalbrine - Big campaign/Session 27 - 2023-07-24.md","exportPath":"02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-27-2023-07-24.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":206,"backlinks":["04_places/shrivell's-reach/mar-dekesh.html"],"type":"markdown"},"02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-28-2023-07-28.html":{"title":"Session 28 - 2023-07-28","icon":"","description":"<a href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se?query=tag:session\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#session\">#session</a>![[]]Började spela omkring: 16:40 ish hos FilipFrån söder:&nbsp;\nHorned Devil\nFrån väst:\n??\nFrån norr:\nLeonin\nBorgha pratar med oss lite och ger oss möjlighet att dricka mer från hans te. Vi alla tar en klunk var.Jag fick temphp (30), Tony +2 Cha mod, Haggan +2 Wis mod, Cory fick välja och tog +2 Dex mod.Tony och Cory drack en gång till var. Tony fick välja Temp hp och Cory fick välja temp hp också.Nu är Borghas te slut.Combat börjar.Jag och Haggan går till Södra gången och möter Devilen.Tony och Cory och Borgha går till Norra gången och möter Leoninen.Cory och Borgha kommer senare dra till Krabban och the Hag.Tony dödade Leonin på två attacker. Första slaget missade, andra var en crit och gjorde 102 damage (han hade Naga-poison på svärdet). Andra attacken var också en crit och Leonin dog.Tony och Cory drog då till Västra sidan och började slåss mot krabban och zombies och en Hag.Jag och Haggan slåss och slåss mot den där Devilen. Vi kör mycket skada men det syns inte ens. Han summonar totalt 4st små-devils som vi har ihjäl.\nVi under denna fighten befinner oss i ett hus där Haggan lyckas avväpna honom. När hans Bident bara ligger på marken skopar jag upp den med Bagge och skickar till the Astral Plane. Efter många många rundor så drar han iväg uppåt och vi hör sedan nåt som låter som en piska i luften. Det visar sig vara Borgha som piskar på Devilen och slåss ordentligt högt uppe i luften. Vi försöker hjälpa till så gott vi kan. Borgha summonar en drake uppe i luften som uppehåller Devilen och kommer sedan ner till oss och säger att vi måste ta oss till Town Square. Cory och Tony dödar zombies och träffar då två allierade som hjälper till. De lyckas ha ihjäl krabban men Night Hagen försvinner. De bestämmer sig för att springa till Town Square också och vi alla möts upp där.Vi pratar lite och Borgha säger att Devilen nog har något item som binder honom till detta planet. Cory och Tony berättar att Bessy är död och frågar ifall det kan hjälpa. Borgha säger “JA har ni dödat Bessy? Det kan vara till stor hjälp!!”Vi drar till där Bessy dog och vi hjälper Borgha slita ut organet han var ute efter. Sen säger han att “Det som har uppehållet Devilen finns inte kvar, vi måste skynda oss. Jag behöver dra till mitt hus först nu”Vi föreslår att vi drar till Mansionen direkt och att vi möts där. Han tycker det är OK.Vi drar mot huset.Väl där ser vi inte någon Devil någonstans, men kan se skepnader uppe I himlen. Vi drar fort in I huset och funderar lite på vad för pryl det kan vara som vi letar efter.Haggan tar I huset och frågar Karat om hjälp. Hon får en uppenbarelse och nån hon tror är Karat eller motsvarande natt-Gud, välsignar Haggan, Bless. Haggan känner sedan en skepnad bakom sig. Hon vänder sig om och ser Irago med utbredda vingar och lysande ögon. “I hear you need help my acolyte” säger Irago på ett språk och med en röst vi andra inte känner igen. Efter det blir han tillbaks till sitt vanliga jag med sin röst och utan lysande ögon.&nbsp;Vi går upp på översta våningen och ser att kropparna som tidigare dog har torkat ut.”Lamal, Stora Dakersha, Kalux, bless me” Irago ute på balkongen ber till månguden. Haggan är med och hör och förstår språket.&nbsp;Efter detta ser och hör vi att stormen skingrar sig. Månen kommer fram och tränger igenom himlen. Den stora hären med små-devils hamnar mitt I månskenet och tinar bort I ljuset.“ååaaah! Det finns något större här, en sann fiende. Kom ut, kom UT!!” ropar Devilen medan han flyger med hög fart nedåt mot oss.Irago vänder på klacken och går ner, Haggan hänger med.Vi andra letar så mycket vi kan inne I huset men hittar inget. Jag använder Detect Magic och ser och känner att inristningarna har en faint aura av Transmutation Magic.Vi alla går ut och möter Devilen. Han är på andra sidan kvarteret. Vi 4 och Irago mot Devilen.Han slänger någon magi och många av oss tappar sinnet lite, de ser bara en illusion av världen. Jag och Irago klarade oss dock.&nbsp;Jag slänger Eldritch blast på min runda, även en tredje gång. Men just denna gången slår jag en 2:a och handsken vände sig emot mig. Jag tappade 21 Max HP och hamnar nu på stabila 12 HP.Vi slåss lite fortsatt. Irago lyckas paralyza Devilen med Hold Monster. Men han lyckas ta sig ut efter en stund. Jag fortsätter skjuta och de andra gör sitt bästa för att göra något åt honom. Irago slänger Bestow Curse på Devilen.&nbsp;En runda senare lyckas han använda en action ändå och skjuter mot mig, antagligen för att jag är den enda som kunde se honom och förstår vad som händer.Han träffar och jag downar.Det går en runda till. Jag får en Success. Ingen annan märker förutom möjligtvis Irago som inte heller är förtrollad av illusionen. Han kommer till mig och använder Spare The Dying på mig och jag blir stable. Unconscious, men stable.Devilen försöker att heala sig själv men denna gången fungerar det inte och han blir lite förvirrad. Irago fortsätter att panga. Cory har tagit tag I en vinge för att hålla fast honom lite.Cory försöker sedan tvinga I honom en Potion of Diminution och&nbsp;lyckas. Devilen krymper till halva storleken.&nbsp;Cory fick inspiration för det!De andra fortsätter slåss och till slut, så är det slut med Devilen.Haggan avslutar fighten genom att kyla ner Devilen med sin döda hand. Hans hud blir mer och mer grå och kyld. Han känns mer och mer liten trots att storleken är densamma. Han blir mer och mer stilla.&nbsp;Tony avslutar det hela med att köra in sitt svärd genom munnen och ut I nacken på han.&nbsp;Devilen tonar bort och blir till aska.&nbsp;Irago healar mig med healing word och jag stapplar sakta tillbaks till de andra. Trött som tjyven och uttömd på energi. Irago healar sedan alla än mer.Haggan “Är det över?”Irago “Det är över. För idag” Hans lie tinar bort I luften.Irago “Jag har sett mer av vad ni kan göra. Ni får ursäkta mig för mitt tvivel. Jag kommer hjälpa er till Dendallens gravplats”Tony är på väg att gå mot Leonin-kroppen när Irago säger till honom “Du borde vara försiktigare med det där. Varje gång du förlitar dig på dennes krafter så tappar du en del av dig själv”&nbsp;“Vad ska jag göra då? Vad kan jag göra för att överleva? Kan du hjälpa mig att bli av med det?”“Inte jag. Men jag vet en som kan. Men gå du och gör ditt”Tony hämtar kroppen. Irago tar honom på axeln och de försvinner iväg. De har en stund gemensamt där.&nbsp;“Är du säker på att du vill gå denna vägen Tony?”“Jag har inget val, vad ska jag göra?”“Man har alltid ett val. Desto längre du går på denna vägen desto svårare kommer det vara att bli av med. Du behöver bestämma dig nu, här och nu”Tony lägger ner kroppen på backen och tar Iragos hand.Tony är inte längre en level 6 Blood HunterTony öppnar ögonen och de är båda I ett tempel ganska likt det som vi var I tidigare för att få Karat’s blessing. Det finns ett hål I taket och månen lyser starkt in. Templet är ensamt, helt tomt.&nbsp;Tony (Linus snarare) kommer behöva göra är tre val, vilken fightingstyle, vilken subclass och vilken&nbsp;-vad det nu det var-&nbsp;han vill vara istället.&nbsp;Tony kommer nu att vara en Paladin.Tillbaka till oss kommer Borgha efter typ 25 minuter. Han har med sig en liten låda med nånting I för att förheliga marken. “Ah jag kom visst lite sent, ni verkar ha löst det redan”.“Jag vet någon som verkligen vill träffa er”&nbsp;Borgha erbjuder sig att lära oss hur man gör en Sanctification Ritual vilket vi accepterar.Till slut kommer Tony och Irago tillbaks och det är inte samma Tony som tidigare idag. Han är förändrad på något sätt. Cory svimmar strax efter.Borgha använder teleport och tar med oss alla till nån smått oklar plats.“Ni är på väg att möta ‘The Grand Speaker’, den store talaren. När ni kommer framför hans närvaro, buga djupt. Han kommer var högst tacksam redan, men det är ändå bra att visa uppskattning. Följ med, det är en kort väg att gå”Vi vandrar iväg ett bra tag, närmare en halvtimme. Vi kommer till en klippvägg och jag ser direkt att det finns en teleportationcircle där på marken.<br>Framme vid väggen så säger Borgha “<a data-href=\"Magazeem\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Magazeem</a>, släpp in oss”. Väggen försvinner, som om det var en illusion.Vi går en bit och ser otroliga mängder med glimmande skatter under enorma braziers. Ovanpå skatten ligger en enorm drake. Hud som blänker som blank, glimrande, speglande mässing.&nbsp;Vi bugar medan draken sakta lyfter sitt huvud.&nbsp;“Ska ni inte introducera er, eller har ni inga namn?”“Hilmia, av landet”“Tony Waru”“Singwin Mistwalker, för närvarande”“Cory”“Ni har gjort väl. Ni har gjort mycket väl. Och ni har på flera sätt hjälpt återhålla balansen I öknen som redan är kluven, och jag är ytterst tacksam. De godhjärtade och heroiska, även om vägen är orättvis, får alltid belöning I slutändan”<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Magazeem\" data-href=\"Magazeem\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Draken</a> andas ut en rök, tung och djup och lägger sig på marken. Och när röken dispersar finns där gåvor till oss.\nCory, ett spjut, det som Leoninen hade,&nbsp;Galepierce Spear\nHaggan, en kappa,&nbsp;Sandstorm Dancer.\nSingwin, en whetstone,&nbsp;Dragonscale Whetstone (Legendary, Brass dragon)\n“Tony, sträck ut din klinga”Draken sänker sitt huvud nära marken.“Sträck ut den, mer”Draken öppnar sitt stora stora gap så att svärdet är inuti munnen.En otrolig hetta kommer ut från munnen. Tonys vapen blir enchantat.“Svep svärdet genom luften”Efter svärdet har färdats så kommer det en skåra I luften från yttersta toppen av klingan som är väldigt varm men emanerar mycket.“Det finns inget jag har I min hoard som ditt hjärta vill ha, Cory. Men det finns något som kan bidra väldigt mycket ändå”Cory får en pouch från den stora högen med skatter som draken ligger på. En pouch som går att använda till mycket, en bag of holding.&nbsp;“Era själar är bundna och sakta tynar de bort. Ni har en besvärjelse över er som ger er tid, men ingen garanti för era liv. Ni har en person ni är bundna till. En mäktig magiker…”“Och jag tror att ni redan har träffat henne, de flesta av er”“En lärjunge till något förgånget och mörkt. Vi kan inte låta det hända igen, som det gjorde för så länge sen.”Haggan “Hur länge sen?”“Första gången, så var jag inte så gammal. Första gången… hmm.. Det måste varit omkring 800 år sedan. Jag var inte mycket mer än en ung drake då. Men även jag led av hans förödelse som svepte över hela världen. Jag bodde inte här. Det finns ett frågetecken, nån som är dold, gömd. Nån som besitter en ofantlig kunskap. Men jag kan inte läsa av denne. Jag kan inte se något öde kring den. Men jag kan se det hos er.”“Ni känner en Gideon. Denna Gideon var där för så länge sen. Han var där, men ändå inte”“Alltid kring när jag försöker att se kring honom, blir tomt. Han vet mycket mer än vad han nånsin visar. Ty han är en varelse äldre än mig. Och jag kan inte besvara om hans ord är att lita på.”Haggan “Kan du se folks förflutna?”“Inte mycket längre än de redan har inom sig. Är det något du tappat bort?”Haggan “Allt”“Hmm”. Draken andas ut en stor dimma igen som täcker en stor yta på marken. När den försvinner så ser vi en medelålders man med ljusbryn hy istället för draken som polymorphat sig.Draken (mannen) går fram till Haggan och han sträcker ut sin hand som Haggan möter med sin spökhand.Han spår tillbaks I Haggans minnen och hon vet inom sig att det är sant det han säger och hon hör. Hon var en gång en ärkedruid. Men hon gav också bort sin själ. Men den även nu tillbaka, men skadad, bruten.Någonting inom henne håller henne vid liv fortfarande.“Jag ser något mer. Jag ser att du I kamp mot två förskräckliga makter, förlorade greppet om din själ. Du är här för att du förlorade. Du är kvar för att I sin dragkamp emot varandra, någon som du gav bort din själ till och någon som försökte stjäla den, hamnade I nån limbo. Din själ är kvar, men skadad och bruten.”“Ni måste bege er. Inte bara till Dendallens fängelse, men förbi den också. Ni har ett viktigt objekt att finna där, ännu vet jag inte vad. Och sen måste ni till arenan.”“Era öden, när jag läser dem, ni kommer att möta era slut eller eran frihet där.““vila nu, vila nu mina småttingar.”Han andas ut en gas än en gång, denna gången som människa istället, och vi somnar.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Session Summary","level":2,"id":"Session_Summary_0"},{"heading":"Recap of last session","level":2,"id":"Recap_of_last_session_0"},{"heading":"Log","level":2,"id":"Log_0"},{"heading":"Cory Inspiration ","level":2,"id":"Cory_Inspiration_#inspiration_0"}],"links":["?query=tag:session","?query=tag:inspiration",".html",".html"],"author":"Rasmus","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-28-2023-07-28.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1730964969203,"modifiedTime":1736872965988,"sourceSize":13106,"sourcePath":"02_Journal/Thalbrine - Big campaign/Session 28 - 2023-07-28.md","exportPath":"02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-28-2023-07-28.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":207,"backlinks":["01_pcs/singwin-mistwalker-folder/character-sheet.html","01_pcs/singwin-mistwalker-folder/while-playing/character-sheet.html","04_places/shrivell's-reach/mar-dekesh.html"],"type":"markdown"},"02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-29-2023-08-13.html":{"title":"Session 29 - 2023-08-13","icon":"","description":"Började spela omkring 15:20.Vi vaknar upp och Haggan känner direkt på doften att något är lite off. Vi kanske är i en grotta, eller någonstans under marken i alla fall. Vi vaknade upp i varsin säng.\nJag fick sova en god natts sömn, för första gången på lääänge.\nDessutom vaknar vi utan alla våra grejer. De verkar ligga i kistan nere vi foten av sängen.\nVi får frukost och annat om vi önskar.Tony säger att han önskar vi ska göra en liten detour. Han behöver visa sig värdig. Men inte till hans gamla fisk-mästare utan någon annan. Nån mångud på Shrivell’s Reach, Lamal.\nSingwin “Men hur varför när hände detta och hur och va liksom hände o va?”\nTony svarar att “Irago hjälpte mig så jag kunde slänga kroppen i havet men han sa även att det kanske inte är en jättebra snubbe att följa och hjälpa. Jag tog beslutet att inte ge kroppen till havet och då tog Irago med mig till ett tempel där jag fick träffa Lamal.”Vi diskutera en stund kring att sälja sin själ och om man är fast någonstans eller till någon. Efter en stund kommer Borgha in och diskuterar lite med oss. Tony frågar Borgha om han känner till någon gravplats som har med Lamal att göra.\nBorgha ”I vilket syfte vill du besöka den här platsen?”\nTony ”Jag behöver visa vad jag går för”\nBorgha ”Jag tror jag förstår vad du menar. Jag har för mig att jag sa till er att vara försiktiga kring Irago..”\nTony ”Men jag vet inte vad jag ska göra. Är Yormund eller Lamal värst?”\nBorgha ”Heheh. Ja det finns en av dem som gör något gott alls i universum. Att gå samma väg som han är ett svårt liv. Allt man gör behöver gå igenom Lamal.\nIrago är vad man kallar för en Herald. En av de 7 som fanns. Han är den enda som är kvar. Dessa 7 hade alla en roll att fylla, en plats att ha i Lamals namn. Och nu är det bara Irago kvar, gammal och grå. Men han är inte ett dugg mindre skräcksam för det. Han verkar inte tappat ett uns av sin kapacitet, en legend i denna öknen.””Det är en enorm gravplats efter ett krig för länge sedan” säger Borgha.Borgha pratar lite om ”de mörka magikerna”, de kraftfullaste som fanns under sin tid. De förlorade kriget men använde mörk och stark magi för att få självaste sanden att komma till liv.\nKarat och Kalux var de två som vann kriget mot de mörka magikerna.\nTvå systergudar Sha, Shelul(?) gav dem gåvor som tack ish.\nKarat fick solen och Kalux fick överträdelsen mellan natt och dag.Deras domäner når egentligen längre än Shrivell’s Reach, men för oss vanliga dödliga som knappt känner till det stora gudomliga kriget verkar det som att deras krafter och områden har förminskats.Gravplatsen innehåller mycket monster och fiender. Borgha markerar en plats på vår karta över Shrivell’s Reach. Ungefär vid ”Crypt of the restless” är den graven som Tony söker. Men han är lite osäker på vad Gideon har markerat på kartan, just Crypt of the Restless. Han vet inte vad det ska betyda.Bad Tea effects\n<img alt=\"Badtea-effects.jpeg\" src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/items/badtea-effects.jpeg\" target=\"_self\"> <br>Vi går ut ur den stora herrgården och kommer ut i en grotta. Den har en sjuuukt stor trappa, verkar stor nog för en drake. Vi kommer upp till stora stora salar. Och till slut kommer vi fram och känner igen oss lite, här var vi precis innan vi kom fram till <a data-href=\"Magazeem\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Magazeem</a>. Men ingen drake syns till. Alla rikedomar och guld och allt har ersatts med sten.\nVåra blickar möts av en mörkhårig äldre man som ställer sig upp och tar på sig en lite rund svart hatt. Det är formen som draken hade när den hade förvandlat sig till alv, en mer hanterbar storlek för oss dödliga.<br>\n”Välkomna” säger <a data-href=\"Magazeem\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Magazeem</a>. ”Jag ser att ni har fler frågor till mig”\n”Ja jo jag har väl några” svarar typ alla vi. ”Men bara om vi tillåts ställa dem”\n”Det tillåter jag. Kom upp hit” säger han och gestikulerar till oss att komma upp på plattformen han står på.\nVi alla går upp och samtidigt kommer massa sand och tar form som en stor vägg av tegelstenar. En eldstad kommer fram och det blir som ett stort fint rum. En soffa kommer fram till oss och han ber oss sitta ner.Jag frågar om han kan se varför jag slutade vara del av Stora G’s gard.\n”Jag ser bara det som ni har inom er. Och du har inget inom dig. Men jag kan se lite innan och lite efter. Jag kan se att du vaknade upp plötsligt i din säng på en annan plats än du minns senast med väskan jämte dig.\nEn sak du behöver veta, är att tid i Astral Plane fungerar inte riktigt som här. Ett år i the Astral Plane kan vara en vecka eller 100 år här. Och jag ser att du redan fått veta hur gammal du faktiskt är, gentemot vad du trott fram tills nu””Så du säger att mina 26 borttappade år i Astral Plane kan vara mycket kortare än 26 år eller mycket mer än 26 år här?””Det stämmer. Jag ser att du har en till fråga, kring whetstonen som jag gav dig. Jag ser din fråga, och Ja, det kan du. Den innehåller en del av min essens och du kan använda den till att både slipa upp vapen OCH crafta items”Frågan jag tänkt ställa var ifall jag skulle kunna crafta item(s) med den whetstonen, vilket då verkar vara ok! Det går att crafta med whetstonen\nDen innehåller 4 lesser essences eller 1 Greater essence\nVarje slipning använder upp en lesser essens\nDet är en draconic essence, vilket kan vara antingen en Primal eller en Arcane essence\nDe andra ställer också frågor och får lite olika typer av svar. En stor svart pärla som ni en gång burit i era händer. Den kan hjälpa dig Tony om du nånsin ska ut på haven igen. Den ger Kalsh’s beskydd till den som har den nära.”Jag vet inte hur er resa kommer sluta. Men jag säger så här, er resa i Shrivell’s Reach denna gången kommer att sluta i Coluseum”<br>”I Gillet finns en äldre herre, en stor sådan, en goliat. Han har en läderskuldra. Runt den kan du se ett likadant halsband.” Svarar <a data-href=\"Magazeem\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Magazeem</a> på Haggans fråga.Några fler frågor kommer och besvaras.Sen är vi nöjda och Magazeem börjar ta bort besvärjelsen med det fina rummet vi befunnit oss i. Efter en stund är rummet borta och han är tillbaks som drake.\nHan frågar vart vi vill ta vägen och vi pekar på Crypt of the restless. Han andas ånga på oss och vi försvinner.När vi öppnar ögonen igen så är vi på en varm plats mitt i öknen. Vi kan se stora sanddynor och en stor krater med otroliga mängder döda kroppar i.Samtidigt som vi färdades genom tid och rum så har Singwin känt sig vid ett nytt efternamn.<br>\nSingwin Mistforger är nu hans nya namn.<a data-href=\"New information#Nytt Efternamn\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/01_pcs/singwin-mistwalker-folder/while-playing/new-information.html#Nytt Efternamn\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">New information &gt; Nytt Efternamn</a>\nVi ser även ett stort hål med endast sandsten runtomkring. Tony säger att det är dit vi ska.\nVi börjar gå dit.På vägen går vi förbi stora mängder med döda kroppar som alla föll i striden som var här för länge sedan.\nHålet när vi kommer närmare är dussintals meter i diameter. Verkar också vara ett 10 meters drop ner till sanden.\nCory plockar ur ett rep och vi klättrar ner på det allihop.Det är väldigt mörkt. Tony slänger light och Cory tar fram en fackla.\nVi kan inte se hur långt allt går. Men vi börjar gå ner och försöker hitta något intressant.Vi ser stora pelare, många meter höga vilka vi går förbi.\nVi går som i en stor sal med än fler pelare och annat. Avståndet mellan pelarna blir längre och längre. Vi tycker det är mörkt och funderar lite på att tända en brazier vi ser en bit upp. Vi försöker på 3 olika sätt men inget lyckades så vi går vidare.Vi tror vi har kommit till nån form av korridor. En bit bort ser vi lite ljus som kommer från taket. Finns en mural på golvet och Haggan försöker tyda. Hon ber oss att ta en titt också och Tony gör det.\nMuralen är från det första från historien om Lamal.\nVi hör viskningar från mörkret. Några i gruppen känner igen ljudet. Vi förstår inte vad de säger men vi förstår innebörden.\n”So it was on the first day of my rule, was the last day of my living”\nGår vidare och hittar en till Mural som Tony tolkar.\n”Me and my kin, blessed be by the mothers to. It was.. forsake the living”\nÄn en till mural ser vi en bit fram\n”A new order was formed for the lands. And you weigh to keep the balance.”\nEfter sista ordet blev det svart. Allt ljus försvann och inte ens vår fackla lyser upp något, becksvart.\nVi alla ser en kontur av något. Konturer utav en stor stor mängd dödskallar. Tony känner igen den och bugar. Haggan bugar också. Jag och Cory gjorde inte det. Vi känner en tydlig känsla emot oss. Mer till oss som inte bugade.\nTony säger ”Jag är här nu”.\nDen säger nånting igen som vi inte förstår och sen drar den sig tillbaka.Efter en kort stund börjar alla braziers tändas bakom oss. Vi ser också en trädörr i vanlig-person-storlek och vi går in.\nDet är mörkt där också. Jag slänger detect magic och känner att det är magiskt mörker. Försöker dispel magic men hittar inte källan av magin och lyckas därmed inte.Tony börjar vandra inåt och vi hänger tätt på. Efter vi gått en stund så blir Haggan huggen i sidan. Efter det blir jag det med.\nVi ropar att vi blivit slagna och Tony rusar åt hållet vi pekar åt, vänster.\nVi fortsätter gå och försöker leta efter källan till mörkret.Vi fightas mot den här. Vi tre i en grupp och Tony själv. Han har försökt slåss mot den där ett tag och under tiden så har någon röst viskat till Tony. Han har försökt fokusera på Lamal som antagligen har viskat till honom. Till slut så fick han fokus och han kunde till slut se monstret och slå det och till slut döda det.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#session"],"headers":[{"heading":"New information","level":2,"id":"New_information_0"},{"heading":"Continue Log","level":2,"id":"Continue_Log_0"}],"links":[".html",".html",".html","01_pcs/singwin-mistwalker-folder/while-playing/new-information.html#Nytt Efternamn"],"author":"Rasmus","coverImageURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/items/badtea-effects.jpeg","fullURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-29-2023-08-13.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":["00_attachments/items/badtea-effects.html"],"createdTime":1770047367632,"modifiedTime":1769971036619,"sourceSize":9989,"sourcePath":"02_Journal/Thalbrine - Big campaign/Session 29 - 2023-08-13.md","exportPath":"02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-29-2023-08-13.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":213,"backlinks":["01_pcs/singwin-mistwalker-folder/while-playing/new-information.html"],"type":"markdown"},"02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-30-2023-08-26-vi-träffar-valetta-i-templet.html":{"title":"Session 30 - 2023-08-26 - Vi träffar Valetta i templet","icon":"","description":"Skulle börjat ish 18, men jag kom sent så det blev närmare 18:45.Vi fortsatte i templet vi varit i ett tag och tog oss förbi ett rum med ett stup i som har plattformar lite spritt från vår sida till andra sidan, dit vi vill ta oss.\nVi tar oss förbi och kommer fram till ett stort rum där vi träffar på <a data-href=\"Valetta Thornbury\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/valetta-thornbury.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Valetta Thornbury</a>, tillsammans med 7 zombies, som har lite frågor till oss och vi några till henne. Hon föreslår att vi arbetar tillsammans lite. Att vi letar upp Dendallens rustning igen och ger tillbaks den och då kommer hon häva förbannelsen över oss. Vi tycker inte om det hon säger och det hon föreslår och vi attackerar henne istället. Vi klår hennes zombies och vi upptäcker att hon har stuckit ifrån oss, men har kvar en illusion av sig.\nNär vi är klara så uttrycker hon att \"det är tråkigt att ni valde att göra så här när vi kunde gjort det enklare och samarbetat.\" Och \"Jag kommer inte hålla igen nästa gång vi ses.\"\nSedan försvann hon och vi letade runt lite och sedan tog en tupplur i stora rummet med stupet.\nVi befinner oss fortfarande under marken i nån begravd byggnad.Vi tar en shortrest då många av oss är rätt skadade.\nEfter det funderar vi på det där rummet vi har framför oss. Många pelare i ett rum med plattformar ovanpå. Utanför dessa är det bara stup ner till mörkret.Vi funderar på ifall vi ska ha hoppa mellan plattformarna eller något annat. Jag föreslår att kanske summa fram min stora Griffon. Det låter bra tycker alla och jag provar bara först att skicka min lilla griffon så det är ok att använda flygande medel. 3 stycken pelare är lite trasiga och kanske kommer välta när man ställer sig på plattformarna. Det finns växtligheter på väggarna runtom i rummet som är stora som oss. Taggiga vines.”Endast mitt ljus kan visa vägen” på golvet på andra sidan står det på golvet.\nEn vag rutten lukt i korridoren på andra sidan. Korridoren lutar nedåt.Vi pratar om Tony lite och just det som stod på golvet och ifall vi kan använda nåt ljus kanske för att ta oss över. Tony provar att svepa med sitt svärd och när efter-svepet av heligt ljus kommer så ser Tony en osynlig plattform genom ljuset. Vi pratar lite med Bagge och han säger att han behöver eventuellt en focus. Men kanske räcker med ett annat specifikt material. Till exempel hur en wizard kan använda fladdermusguano för att kasta ett eldklot.\nJag funderar lite, och eftersom vi kommer från fel håll så kanske det finns något användbart på andra sidan som kan användas istället för ett fokus.\nSkickar iväg min lilla griffon igen och den letar lite efter nåt användbart. Där hittar den nån form av mineral i väggen som glimmar något väldigt när ljuset ovanför speglas i den. Försöker få ut lite med griffonen men funkar dåligt. Jag skjuter en eldritch blast på den och vi får en liten bit som griffon tar med tillbaks. Det är genomskinlig fältspat.\nTony känner att den borde funka men han behöver något mer. Den är nog bara hälften av det som krävs.Vi kom på att kanske Vinesen är det andra vi behöver. Vi försöker lösa det men griffon klarar inte att riva loss något själv, det är för taggigt. Jag når inte heller med en eldritch blast.. Haggan försöker växa ut nya såna dära växter lite närmare. Men jag når inte ändå.\nJag misty steppar upp till första plattformen och försöker nå istället, vilket funkar bra. Griffonen försöker men den är för vass. Jag skär av lite av min mantel och ger till griffonen för att skydda lite. Det funkar lite bättre, men det är fortfarande för taggigt och han tar skada. Den kommer tillbaks, blodig och lämnar vinen till mig.Jag hoppar tillbaka och får hjälp att klättra upp av Cory och sedan får Tony den och då lyckas han slänga en stor moonbeam som då rör sig framåt och fram kommer en plattform, en till och sedan än fler hela vägen över och skapar en bro till andra sidan. Vi lyckas hänga med och komma över bron.Vi ser att det finns en till text på Rakash precis ovanför texten som min fågel läste tidigare. Bagge kan tydligen Rakash och kallar det ”ett av de vanliga språken”. Det står exakt samma sak som på common.Vi börjar snart gå vidare.\nHaggan: ”Det luktar ruttet..”\nVi ser även något ljus som kommer nerifrån. Vi går vidare.Kommer till ett rum med pelare utsatta på sidorna av rummet. På andra sidan det ganska stora rummet ser vi figurer. Mänskligt lika men bleka. Alla utom en. En kvinna med helsvart klädsel med axlar som täcks av svarta fjädrar. Hon har mycket smycken. Svart mellanlångt hår.\nHon noterar att vi är här, men hon säger ingenting och gör ingenting. Dock en del av de som finns runtomkring henne vänder sig mot oss och drar sina vapen.\nHon pratar med de som är nära henne.”Det ser ut som att vi har fått gäster..” säger hon och vänder sig till oss. Hon verkar vänta på att vi ska göra något.\nTony börjar gå fram och ropar ett par frågor men hon svarar inte.\nTony ser då att det är 6 stycken undead och en är betydligt mycket större, den är lika lång som det är högt i tak.\nVi andra hänger på Tony, jag dock en bit bakom.<br>När de kommer närmare märker dem att det är <a data-href=\"Valetta Thornbury\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/valetta-thornbury.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Valetta Thornbury</a>, hon som la cursen på oss, hon som vi stal ifrån.\n”Hur kom ni hit?” - Valetta. ”Även om det inte är viktigt för er så är det viktigt för mig.”\n”Vi tog oss över de där plattformarna där innan…”\nValetta: ”Ni vet vad jag menar. Berätta. Hur tog ni er hit?”\nCory: ”Magi”\nValetta: ”Jaha, så ni fick hjälp..”Hon fortsätter fråga lite, t.ex ”Hur kunde ni undgå min besvärjelse?” Vi har inte exakta svaret på det, vilket hon förstod.\nVi får ställa nån fråga också och frågar varför hon är här och hon svarar ”för att lösa ett problem med någon som är starkare än mig” typ. En fiende, grupp av hags, coven, som hon försöker bli av med.\nHon föreslår att vi inte behöver vara fiender, utan vi kan vara kumpaner. Hon kan ta bort besvärjelsen om vi gör några uppdrag åt henne. Hon vill ha tillbaks Dendallens rustning. Vilket vi inte är supersugna på.Cory försöker övertala Valetta att ta bort cursen från honom då HAN inte har gjort något själv mot henne. Vilket hon inte riktigt köper just nu.”Jag hade tänkt föra tillbaks rustningen till där den, inte hör hemma, men där den bör vara för världens bästa”.<br>”Denna coven består som alltid utav en grupp på tre. Aldrig fler, aldrig färre.” säger Valetta. ”<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Gull’a\" data-href=\"Gull’a\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/gull’a.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Rann’i</a>, finns här. Hon är en s.k grön hagga. <a data-href=\"Borhild\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Borhild</a>, en mörkerhagga (dusk hag). Och deras ledare, <a data-href=\"Enhjabat\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Enhjabat</a> (night hag), den klyftigaste utav dem tre. De har gjort avbilder av sig själva så de kan vara i öknen utan att själva ta skada. Så de ni har träffat är inte de riktiga, utan bara en avbild av dem.”Diskussioner fortsätter med frågor från båda håll. Vi frågar lite varför hon vill ha rustningen och vad hon ska göra med den. Hon vill inte berätta exakt, utan bara att hon vill hjälpa rädda världen. Och att vi inte förstår vilka problem som kommer uppkomma ifall vi inte gör något åt dem.\nHaggorna vill skapa arméer för att kunna fajtas mot demonerna, deras ärkefiender typ. Hon säger att haggorna kommer sluka hundratusentals av själar för att bygga deras arméer. Ö efter ö kommer slukas av detta mörker de skapar.Tony har funderat lite. Han börjar gå fram mot henne och säger åt Valetta att hon inte hör hemma här, hon borde lämna Lamals tempel. Och han går fram och attackerar henne, hon ser det och försöker hinna före, men Tony skjuter först. Hon försöker använda nån magi efter men jag counterspellar den.- Vi går in i combat -När vi är klara så märker vi att Valetta inte är där. Det är bara en illusion. Hon klappar långsamt och pratar med oss. ”Är det allt ni kan ge? Då vet jag vad ni vill, ni valde att gå denna vägen. Ni hade chansen att gå tillsammans med mig här men icke. Jag kommer inte att ta bort cursen.”\n”Nästa gång vi ses så kommer jag inte hålla tillbaka.”\n”Allt kunde gått så mycket enklare. Men istället valde ni detta. Att ni nu, trötta och slut på krafter ska gå vidare och slåss mot en Hagga. Lycka till.”\nSen tynar hon bort.Vi pratar lite allmänt.Jag går och kollar över lite av alla vätskor som står på hyllor på väggen. Hittar en Potion of Spell Recovery och en Potion of Invulnerability, samt två scrolls; Mass Healing Word och Aura of Vitality.Vi behöver sova en stund allihopa då alla mår väldigt dåligt. Vi tror att vi, eller snarare Tony i alla fall, behöver hjälpa Lamal genom att förgöra Haggan som bor i detta templet.Vi bestämmer oss för att ta en long rest i rummet med stupet och så sätter vi oss så långt vi kan till ena sidan och vilar.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#session"],"headers":[{"heading":"Session Summary","level":2,"id":"Session_Summary_0"},{"heading":"Log","level":2,"id":"Log_0"}],"links":["03_npcs/valetta-thornbury.html","03_npcs/valetta-thornbury.html","03_npcs/gull’a.html",".html",".html"],"author":"Rasmus","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-30-2023-08-26-vi-träffar-valetta-i-templet.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1730964968310,"modifiedTime":1695710863182,"sourceSize":9243,"sourcePath":"02_Journal/Thalbrine - Big campaign/Session 30 - 2023-08-26 - Vi träffar Valetta i templet.md","exportPath":"02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-30-2023-08-26-vi-träffar-valetta-i-templet.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":209,"backlinks":["02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-31-2023-09-18.html"],"type":"markdown"},"02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-31-2023-09-18.html":{"title":"Session 31 - 2023-09-18","icon":"","description":"Började spela omkring 16:30.<a data-href=\"Current Goals - Singwin Mistforger#^currentquests\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/05_quests/current-goals-singwin-mistforger#^currentquests\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Current Goals - Singwin Mistforger &gt; ^currentquests</a><br>Tony hade problem att sova och fick ingen vila. Vi drog oss vidare och kom till något rum fyllt av illusioner vi lyckades dispella. Där inne i en cell sitter <a data-href=\"Gull’a\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/gull’a.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Gull’a</a>, en grön Hagga. Hon har väntat på oss. Vi pratar lite och Singwin ger till slut henne en flaska med Te som en peace offering då vi börjar bråka lite efter Tony sköt mot henne. När hon dricker den så är en av effekterna hon får att hon teleporteras utanför gallret hon vart innanför. Direkt kommer strid och vi slåss mot vad vi upptäcker är en fejk-hagga och sedan 2 skuggor.\nEfter detta hjälper vi en dödskalle att få tillbaks sin kropp och vi hjälper hans ande till efterlivet efter han hjälpt oss med lite frågor vi haft\nVi drar vidare till där Haggan faktiskt befinner sig. Hon hälsar oss välkomna och vi ser henne och hennes stora fyraarmade-demon kompis Poppy.\nVi fortsatte i templet vi varit i ett tag och tog oss förbi ett rum med ett stup i som har plattformar lite spritt från vår sida till andra sidan, dit vi vill ta oss.<br>\nVi tar oss förbi och kommer fram till ett stort rum där vi träffar på <a data-href=\"Valetta Thornbury\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/valetta-thornbury.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Valetta Thornbury</a>, tillsammans med 7 zombies, som har lite frågor till oss och vi några till henne. Hon föreslår att vi arbetar tillsammans lite. Att vi letar upp Dendallens rustning igen och ger tillbaks den och då kommer hon häva förbannelsen över oss. Vi tycker inte om det hon säger och det hon föreslår och vi attackerar henne istället. Vi klår hennes zombies och vi upptäcker att hon har stuckit ifrån oss, men har kvar en illusion av sig.\nNär vi är klara så uttrycker hon att \"det är tråkigt att ni valde att göra så här när vi kunde gjort det enklare och samarbetat.\" Och \"Jag kommer inte hålla igen nästa gång vi ses.\"\nSedan försvann hon och vi letade runt lite och sedan tog en tupplur i stora rummet med stupet.\nVi får sova hela natten men Tony fick inte en så bra sömn.\nHan bara grymtar och säger att han inte fått sova alls. Haggan helar honom men han fortsätter vara sur. Hon helar igen och sen börjar vi röra oss.\nVi går tillbaks till rummet där vi slogs igår. Haggan känner en bris som blåser någonstans ifrån. Ber om hjälp från Tony men han vägrar.\nVi hittar två gångar vi inte vart i, vi bestämmer oss för att gå den vänstra. Väldigt mörkt. Väggar och sånt ser spruckna ut.\nEfter en stund byts stenen ut mot jord och vi möts av en dörr. Haggan försöker vibea med naturen här och drar handen mot väggen. Efter en stund blir hon överraskad av en tusenfoting som hugger mot henne. Den missar och drar sig sedan tillbaks in i väggen.Diskussion uppkommer när Haggan högt funderar på vad för Hagga som bor här, en grön kanske? Tony tycker det är fullständigt ointressant information och de skriker på varandra en del. Tony går fram till dörren och lyssnar på den och sen kollar i nyckelhålet. Det verkar vara nån som lagar mat där inne. Han hörde också något skrapande ljud ifrån rummet.Haggan blir till gas och flyger in i rummet och kollar runt.\nRummet känns hemtrevligt med nylagad mat och en stor kittel. Hon ser en tom gungstol, som gungar. En del av prylarna känns onormala. De känns inte äkta. Haggan märker att väggen mitt emot också verkar konstig. Hon flyger emot den, och igenom den. Väl igenom vänder hon sig om och ser att inte något är som hon trodde. Rummet är gammalt, maten är rutten, och det sitter en grön dam i gungstolen och gungar.\nHaggan ser också att trädörren vi står vid inte finns egentligen.\nHon kommer till oss och öppnar dörren ”som inte finns” på andra sidan från oss. Hon säger att det är en illusion, varpå jag direkt slänger Dispel Magic och lyckas förstöra illusionen.Vi funderar på att gå in. Haggan i stolen säger ”I like having guests, but I’d rather take all of you at once”.\nJag och Cory är sist kvar men vi går in också, trots oro och att det känns dumt, vi har ändå inget annat val.Hon ber oss komma närmare och frågar oss vad vi gör här.\nTony responderar med att skicka en Ice Knife på henne, som missar men explosionen träffar. Hon blir skitsur och rusar på alla fyra mot gallret och tar tag i första bästa, Haggan i detta fallet.\nHon ropar att hon har bjudit in oss och det är så här vi behandlar en henne som bjudit in oss?! Lite diskussion. <br><a data-href=\"Gull’a\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/gull’a.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Gull’a</a> introducerar hon sig som när vi säger våra namn.<br>\nHon känner inte till nån <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Gull’a\" data-href=\"Gull’a\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/gull’a.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Rann’i</a> som <a data-href=\"Valetta Thornbury\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/valetta-thornbury.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Valetta Thornbury</a> nämnde igår.Jag erbjuder henne téet som jag fick av Borgha tidigare. Säger att det kanske kan va gott. Tänker att det är som en peaceoffering.\nHon dricker den. Hon fryser i en sekund. Hon börjar bli statisk och lite blixtrande. Och hon teleporteras igenom gallret.\nTony responderar på det med en Moon Beam i ansiktet på henne och fight är igång.Efter en kort kort stund så börjar hon brinna upp i vit eld och faller till marken. Bara hennes rock är kvar.\nBjörn-Haggan drar ut rocken ur Moon Beamen, och hittar där en ring och nycklar som hon hållt i tidigare.\nHon ger nycklarna till Tony och ringen till mig. Samtidigt ser vi att två stora skuggfigurer som krupit fram ur rocken och går emot oss.\nFight fortsätterVi lyckas panga skuggmonstrerna. Vår Hagga är fundersam på om detta var riktiga Gull’a. Hon tror att den fortfarande lever och att detta bara var en kopia.Ringen hon hade på sig är en Ring of Soul Storing. Används till att bära själar. Skuggorna som släpptes ut var själar som satt i ringen. Innanför gallret som hon satt på andra sidan av, ser vi att det finns hyllor fyllda med burkar som innehåller ögon, naglar, hår och annat.\nLängre bort i rummet ser vi en hand, en typ människohand som håller i en skalle. Den verkar röra sig. Vi funderar på ifall hon kanske kan se oss genom skallen.\n”Skulle jag? Vafalls!?” - säger skallen.”Mitt namn är La. Jag har varit här väldigt länge. Jag var här med mina 2 kusiner och min mamma..”. Den fortsätter snacka goja en bra stund och vi blir förvirrade. Vår Hagga tar upp skallen och den ropar ”NEJ, fortsätt INTE”. Vi börjar förstå, den verkar snacka tvärtom, den får inte säga sanningen. Haggan frågar ”Vart är INTE Haggan?” och den svarar ”Haggan är INTE djupare in här”.Cue många diffusa inverterade frågor.Det finns en till skalle som bara talar sanning istället. Poppy är en demon, hon har en amulet som La vill att vi ska förstöra så de kan vila. Då kommer nog La och den andra han pratat om. Poppy är Haggans typ kompis.Vi kommer fram till att det finns en till skalle typ som han vill ha åt innan vi drar vidare. Och det är bråttom.\nVi hittar ben till två varelser i två olika urnor. Sen behövs något mer för att det ska funka.<br>\nAlla burkar runtomkring står det namn på, i Rakash. Det står <a data-href=\"Alham &amp; Doni\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/alham-&amp;-doni.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Alham &amp; Doni</a> på dem. Vi ställer allt som det står Alham på jämte en hög med ben och sen spillde Tony lite blod på benen och då började en ande flyta upp och prata med oss, normalt, istället för tvärtom/lögner.Haggan har ganska nyligen gått med i en Coven. Vi måste ta oss ner till henne. Hon har en nyckel som gör att hon kan sära på marken och leda henne rakt ner. Vi måste ta tunnlarna ner, som är fyllda av insekter och djur. En svår väg.Poppy hette Mikajla. En Draegloth.<br>\nDe var Drow förr. Mikajla var Alham och Doni’s Mistress. Men hon blev bedragen av <a data-href=\"Gull’a\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/gull’a.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Gull’a</a>. Halsbandet han nämnt tidigare är en återbetalning till oss. Om vi förstör amuletten och ögat, så kommer Haggan själv vara blind en tid framåt. Den sitter alltid runt nacken på Poppy. Hon är stor har 4 armar och hon är magiker i grunden. Hon kan enchanta våra sinnen, så att vi tror att varandra är fiender. Hon är verkligen mäktig. Ingen man vill vara nära länge.Haggor är bundna till att alltid tänka högst om sig själva. Så var och en av dessa tre i Coven, ser sig själv som över de andra två. Gull’a talar alltid om att hon har övertaget om de andra och att hon ska överta dem någon gång framöver. Det vi såg här var en av hennes flesh-puppets. Det har ett pris att skaffa sådana. Det kräver själar. Undvik det demonerna är starka emot, gift. Men de har inte direkt några svagheter. Lite fler frågor ställs till Alham. När vi är nöjda frågar han flera gånger ifall vi inte har fler frågor. Vi säger till slut nej och ber han passera till nästa liv. Han tackar för hjälpen och försvinner. Inget mer än lite damm är kvar.Vi funderar lite på hur vi ska gå vidare. Tony är helt uttorkad på energi och måste ha en long rest. Vi andra försöker ta short rest, Cory också efter han vart och satt Alarm en bra bit bort i tunneln vi ska i senare.\nShort resten funkar ok.\nJag ger Tony min Potion of Spell storing, då han ännu en gång inte kunde sova ordentligt.Vi börjar röra oss i grottan i ordningen; Haggan, Cory, Singwin, Tony.\nVi kryper framåt och efter en stund ser vi mängder av spindlar. De är inte jättelångt bort men de håller sig ändå på det avståndet.\nVi alla blir attackerade av var sin spindel. Men inte mer, de är för rädda för elden.Vi kommer fram till en stor sal, en stor sal fylld av becksvart mörker som täcker rummet.\nVi ser en enorm figur en bra bit bort som rör sig hastigt.<br>\nStrax börjar den prata och det är <a data-href=\"Gull’a\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/gull’a.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Gull’a</a>. Hon säger att hon har väntat och planerat inför att vi ska komma.\nPlötsligt kommer vines bakom oss som skjutsar oss framåt. Jag och Tony lyckas hitta fotfäste dit vi skjutsas, medan Cory och Haggan trillar mellan stenarna vi står vid.\nVi ser in i mörkret som börjar skingra sig. Där ser vi en stor 4 armad best. Det måste va Poppy.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#session"],"headers":[{"heading":"Session Summary","level":1,"id":"Session_Summary_0"},{"heading":"Recap of last session","level":1,"id":"Recap_of_last_session_0"},{"heading":"Log","level":1,"id":"Log_0"},{"heading":"Ny dag, nya problem","level":2,"id":"Ny_dag,_nya_problem_0"},{"heading":"Träffar Haggan Gull’a","level":2,"id":"Träffar_Haggan_Gull’a_0"},{"heading":"Snack med skallen","level":2,"id":"Snack_med_skallen_0"},{"heading":"Planering inför attack","level":2,"id":"Planering_inför_attack_0"}],"links":["05_quests/current-goals-singwin-mistforger.md#^currentquests","03_npcs/gull’a.html","03_npcs/valetta-thornbury.html","03_npcs/gull’a.html","03_npcs/gull’a.html","03_npcs/valetta-thornbury.html","03_npcs/alham-&-doni.html","03_npcs/gull’a.html","03_npcs/gull’a.html"],"author":"Rasmus","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-31-2023-09-18.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":["02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-30-2023-08-26-vi-träffar-valetta-i-templet.html"],"createdTime":1730964968503,"modifiedTime":1731699500898,"sourceSize":9319,"sourcePath":"02_Journal/Thalbrine - Big campaign/Session 31 - 2023-09-18.md","exportPath":"02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-31-2023-09-18.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":210,"backlinks":["02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-32-2023-10-01.html","03_npcs/alham-&-doni.html"],"type":"markdown"},"02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-32-2023-10-01.html":{"title":"Session 32 - 2023-10-01","icon":"","description":"Session number: 58\nBörjade spela omkring: &lt;% tp.file.creation_date(HH:mm) %&gt;Vi börjar slåss mot <a data-href=\"Gull’a\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/gull’a.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Gull’a</a> och hennes undersåtar.

Hon håller på o grejar med något vi inte ser vad uppe på sin stora plattform på andra sidan rummet. Det går inte komma upp där utan man måste gå runt på trappor för att komma upp till henne.<br>Haggan trollar fram ett moln och en blixt slår ner mot <a data-href=\"Gull’a\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/gull’a.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Gull’a</a> men den träffar endast en osynlig barriär långt ovanför där hon står.Jag försöker dispella barriären men misslyckas. Den är omöjlig att dispella.Hon pratar lite med oss och uttrycker tråkigheten med att vi attackerade henne. Hon tar bort allt mörker som varit på marken. Vi ser då Poppy stå på andra sidan av stenen Tony är närmast. <br>Sen skickar jag fram min lilla griffon till den stora Poppy. Griffon gör en <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Items.canvas\" data-href=\"Items.canvas\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/01_pcs/singwin-mistwalker-folder/while-playing/items.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Hypnotizing Gaze</a> och LYCKAS på Poppy.

Tony kände sedan efter i springan och upptäcker att springan ÄR ögat. Poppy har ett öga i bröstet. Tony försöker hugga ögat men missar och trillar ner på marken och på vägen ner råkar han slå till Poppy så den tar en skada och därmed vaknar Poppy upp från sin vila.Tony downar två gånger under fighten men vi lyckas till slut hjälpa honom upp och han är på banan igen. Jag skjuter för fullt mot Poppy och den dör till slut.\nVi börjar ta oss mot haggan och i respons tar hon upp en kub, trycker på en knapp på den och hon försvinner. Vi försöker se nåt sätt att hitta henne.<br>\nCory tror han lyckas hitta spår att följa. Haggan försöker stämma av med Lamal och rummet. Hon får höra att <a data-href=\"Gull’a\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/gull’a.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Gull’a</a> inte är i detta rummet.\nCory upptäcker att väggen i änden av den höga plattformen är en illusion. Jag märker det och går närmare och skjuter igenom väggen och hoppas jag träffar något. Sedan försvinner jag och hamnar i the Ethereal Plane med hjälp av Blink och ser då att väggen inte finns där, samt att det finns en glow med lysande guldigt skimmer. Där ser jag en stor oval spegel.

Poppy framförallt. <a data-href=\"Gull’a\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/gull’a.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Gull’a</a> går inte att komma åt visar det sig så vi kör på Poppy. <a data-href=\"Gull’a\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/gull’a.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Gull’a</a> står under tiden på plattformen ovanför och slänger potions på oss och på Poppy.<br>\nVi lyckas Incapacitatea Poppy med hjälp av min griffons <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Items.canvas\" data-href=\"Items.canvas\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/01_pcs/singwin-mistwalker-folder/while-playing/items.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Hypnotizing Gaze</a> och letar då efter det omtalade halsbandet. Till slut upptäcker vi att Poppy har ett öga i bröstkorgen, ett riktigt öga. Vi lyckas slå ögat till slut och <a data-href=\"Gull’a\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/gull’a.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Gull’a</a> tyckte inte om det så mycket. Poppy dör och vi börjar jaga <a data-href=\"Gull’a\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/gull’a.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Gull’a</a> men hon blir osynlig och sen sticker hon. Hon verkar ha gått igenom en vägg som visade sig vara en illusion och sedan igenom en portal som verkade gå till the Fey Wild. Tony i sin ilska och sitt tunnelseende rusar rätt in i portalen.\nVi andra springer in i portalen och hittar Tony där. Men Haggan är borta. Jag ser henne inte ens när jag fortsatt Blink:ar in och ut från Ethereal Plane. Landskapet vi kommer till är vackert. Molnen i himlen ser ut att byta form flera gånger i minuten. Mycket färger överallt. Vi ser svampar som ser relativt vanliga ut förutom att de alla består av flera olika färger.Cory hittar ett par spår som leder TILL spegeln från en bäck i närheten. Då upptäcker han att hans egna fotspår är bakvända när han går. Så spåren leder från spegeln till bäcken. På andra sidan bäcken finns det en skog.\nVi ser att spegeln med portalen vi kom ifrån börjar stängas. Vi får nog stanna kvar här. Haggan säger att om vi pratar med någon här så ska vi nog välja våra ord väl. Tony kommer till oss snart och säger att folk från the Fey Wilds är väldigt luriga, men de kan inte ljuga.Cory hjälper Haggan för att komma över bäcken. Haggan klättrar sedan upp på Cory och kollar runt lite i träden. Tony är väldigt väldigt trött och ser ganska krasslig ut. Vi kommer fram till att jag och Tony får vila lite och under tiden går Cory och Haggan iväg och letar efter ledtrådar.Jag och Tony tar oss över bäcken till skogen där de andra två var. Tony snubblade dock och blev väldigt blöt och kall. När han kommer upp efter ha snubblat i vattnet så tycker han att allt annat byter färg hela tiden, skogen som var blå är nu röd, nu grön, nu brun och nu blå igen. Han tycker jag börjar byta färg också. Nåt är konstigt.Han kommer över och lägger sig i skogen där vi andra är nu och fortsätter vila. Haggan är övertygad om att Tony har tagit i en sån där färgglad svamp men han lovar att han inte gjort det.\nJag nämner att hans fossingar är våta och hjälper honom att torka sina skor. Då säger han att färgerna slutar förändras utan nu har de stannat.Cory och Haggan drar iväg nu. Jag upptäcker att det börjar växa gräs igen på Tonys kropp och nämner det till honom. Han svarar bara att äsch sluta prata med mig jag behöver sova. Då säger jag att ”jaha men då får du stå för det själv. Accepterar du detta Tony?” Han svarar inte. Så jag lägger några fingrar bakom huvudet på honom, får hans huvud att nicka och säger tyst för mig själv ”ja jag accepterar.”\n”Vad bra!” säger jag och ser till att min griffon var vittne till att Tony accepterade det.\nPratar lite med Bagge sen som då nämner att Tony har en förbannelse över sig och inte kommer kunna sova alls om han inte har något beskydd. Jag väcker Tony igen och säger det så han kan sova. Han gör någon magi (Protection from Evil and Good) och sen somnar han som en stock.<br>Cory och Haggan kommer till oss strax efter och frågar om jag kan prata med <a data-href=\"Holger\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Holger</a>, en drake de hittade. Vi krånglar lite och sen provar vi prata Alviska med den och det funkar bra, det förstår <a data-href=\"Holger\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Holger</a>.<br>Det diskuteras lite kring om det finns någon säker plats vi kan vila på och han har en tanke på vart det kan finnas en sån plats, men han vill ha någon mat i gengäld. Cory gräver upp något ur väskan, några gamla frukter. <a data-href=\"Holger\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Holger</a> säger till oss att ”Han som ligger där (Tony) kanske inte borde ligga kvar där om han inte vill bli gräs.” Varpå vi sparkar lite på Tony så han vaknar och upptäcker det själv. <a data-href=\"Holger\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Holger</a> äter det Cory plockade fram och sen börjar vi gå.Vi hör någon musik en bra bit bort som kommer närmare när vi går åt hållet mot den säkra platsen. Det står ett litet band på en träscen som spelar musik. De ser exotiska ut. Hon som sjunger och är i framkant är någon man verkligen njuter av att kolla på. De flesta är av andra för oss okända raser men alla ser spännande ut. Av de få vi känner igen är en av dem är en satyr och en annan är en alv med en orange-brun ton i håret och huden.Det finns banners lite överallt och det verkar vara något event igång.\nVi ser en annan som sticker ut en del, en Harengon med rosa klänning ser vi som går runt en del. <br>Platsen eller området vi befinner oss på heter <a data-href=\"Tree Crown\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Tree Crown</a>Tony nämner igen att han mår skit och vill sova till oss och blir lite sur. Vi säger att vi är på väg att hitta något. Tony blir bara mer sur. Jag säger då att jag kan ta med honom iväg och leta upp nånstans att vila, men jag klagar lite på hans attityd.Vi tar oss över till där typ paraden befinner sig och jag ser att lite Harengons kollar mot oss och pratar på vad vi antar är Sylvan. Jag pratar lite högre på Elvish och frågar ifall någon här kan alviska. Jag får svar från två större, äldre herrar vid sidan av och pratar lite med dem. Vi får lite hjälp och de tycker vi ska prata med prinsessan, hon i rosa, så kanske hon kan hjälpa. Jag tackar för oss och vi börjar gå ditåt. Dock inte Tony som börjar följa efter de två äldre herrarna som han trodde skulle leda honom. Jag ropar på han och sen börjar vi gå mot hon i rosa.Vi kommer fram till henne. Lite ljusare päls än många andra här, mer ljusbrun päls. Hon sitter och ser förtvivlad ut, hon snyftar över knäna och blir tröstad av två andra vid sidan av.”My beloved Pocky has ran away and I can’t find him. Mostly brown, but depends on the mood.” Pocky är en katt som sprungit bort. Hon vill ha hjälp med det och sen kan hon tänka sig hjälpa oss med vad vi än behöver.Pocky sprang mot Ruinerna en bit bort. Fått pekat åt vilket håll Hennes far är en sorcerer som har trollat fram alla tälten och allt vi ser här.\nHennes far försvann tillsammans med deras horn cornicopia. <br><a data-href=\"Charmion\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Charmion</a>, ledare av nån trupp. The Pipers’ Queen kallas hon. Hon längst fram av gruppen som spelade flöjt.<br>\n<a data-href=\"Princess Pastella Perk\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Princess Pastella Perk</a> heter prinsessan.<br>Vi ska gå till <a data-href=\"Charmion\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Charmion</a> och berätta att Prinsessan har bett att hon ska hjälpa oss lite. Berättar för Cory och Haggan vad som hänt och vad tanken är.<br>\nVi ska helt enkelt gå till <a data-href=\"Charmion\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Charmion</a> för att kanske ge lite helande till Tony. Sen ska vi dra till ruinerna för att leta upp hennes katt Pocky och lämna tillbaks. Då kanske vi kan få lite mer hjälp sen.<br><a data-href=\"Charmion\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Charmion</a> är Satyren i truppen. Hon spelar klart sin låt och sen vinkar hon till resten av truppen och sen går hon ner och möter oss. Hon pratar Common med oss. Säger att Prinsessan har skickat oss och att då hon kanske kan hjälpa. Berättar om att Tony mår lite skit. Hon säger att hon kan hjälpa. Vi går med henne. Hon leder oss till ett tält och ber oss lägga oss ner. Vi somnar snabbt. Vi vaknar till och det är mörkt i rummet vi är. Det enda ljuset vi har är det som kommer genom tunna strimmor och lägger sig på henne. Det är första gången vi upplever hur vacker hon är. Vi är lite ovana till den väldiga lättklädnaden som är här. Hon har bara ett tunt, lätt genomskinligt linne på sig.Vi har ett gott, lyckligt och tillfredsställt humör när vi vaknar. (vad det nu ska betyda)\nHon säger att hennes bandmedlemmar har väntat länge nog och hon börjar dra sig. Hon nämner också ”under tiden ni sov så har en person ni skulle vilja prata med återvänt.”\n”Är det Prinsessans far?” frågar jag, varpå hon svarar ja.\nSen går hon ut. Vi går till dem och ser där en ännu större och grövre Harengon, hennes far. Kungen då, antagligen. Har ett samlat, fokuserat uttryck. <br>Vi träffar kungen, <a data-href=\"The King of Perk\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The King of Perk</a> och han är lite mer proper än prinsessan. Vi hälsar och han ber oss STRIKT att buga, han är ju ändå en kung?? Vi pratar lite och han säger att om Pocky tar skada EFTER att vi har tagit henne till hands så kommer han fullständigt förstöra oss. Men annars, om vi tar henne tillbaks helskinnad så ska vi bli trevligt belönade med en stor feast.\nVi pratar lite och Cory frågar om han sett någon Grön Hagga. Varpå diskussion ensues och han pratar lite om haggor, frågar lite om vad vi vet och så. <br>”<a data-href=\"Wilwol Wilds\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Wilwol Wilds</a>. Barren entrance of ruins, mostly fallen. It stands out” säger han.\nHaggan ber om något som hon kan sniffa på som björn och vi får en korg som hon sover i. <br><a data-href=\"The King of Perk\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The King of Perk</a> leder oss till det stora typ tältet och Pockys sovplats. Hilmia sniffar och vi börjar bege oss. Vi vet inget om denna typen av skogen. Vi smälter inte in så bra här.\nAlla varelser vi ser är surrealistiska. De ser inte ut som vi tänker, de beter sig inte som vi är vana vid och de är förmågor vi aldrig sett. Vi går en bra bit men hittar ännu inget. Cory stannar oss. De har hört något oklart fnittrande flera gånger. Jag och Tony hör inget.\nBjörn-Hilmia går fortsatt framåt och då plötsligt fångas hon upp i ett stort nät. Då hör jag och Tony också det där skrattet. Jag försöker med hjälp av min griffon lokalisera skrattet.\nCory försökte skära ner repet men lyckades inte helt. Från ett annat rep kommer en kruka svingandes mot Hilmia och väl ovanför, vänds den uppochner och hon får en grön klet over sig som nästan får henne att kräkas.\nCory försöker igen att kapa repet, han kommer närmare lukten och börjar kräkas. Men det som kommer ut är inte spya, utan mynt med någons namn på??\nAnvänder Prestidigitation för att tvätta bort gojset Björn-Hilmia har på sig. Kommer kanske ta en stund men kan tvätta bort lite i taget.\nHilmia tar sig ut ur nätet. Tony har letat lite men har inte hittat nån. Han tror bara det är några ungar som skojjar med oss.\nVi fortsätter följa spåren och vi kommer fram till ruiner. Björn-Hilmia startar sitt sökuppdrag. Vi andra letar också på våra håll. Min griffon håller lite vakt ovanför ruinerna.Hilmia hittar en väg dit spåret leder. På vägen dit så blir vi överraskade av två Kattliknande djur.\nJag får nån form av överväldigande feeling att Displacer Beasts!? De är JÄTTESÄLLSYNTA och supervärdefulla. Deras hud är extremt värdefullt och jag kan få MYCKET pengar för det. Har något knas i skallen.\nJag blir väldigt överraskad och attackerad bakifrån. När vi slagit ihjäl en och skrämt bort resten så kommer känslan över mig igen. Jag behöver den hiden. Det ligger en död här jämte så jag börjar skinna den. De andra frågar under tiden vad jag gör, men säger bara som det är, jag skinnar en Displacer Beast. Lägger den sen i Bagge.Vi rör oss uppåt över pelarna.\nPå andra sidan stupet så kommer vi till en nästan helt annan skog.\nVi ser sen ovanpå en mur en bit bort att det finns en liten hårboll av något slag liggandes. Det som är där har en brun ganska lång päls, lång svans.<br>\nJag börjar prata med den (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Feathren - Traits > ^39c1ee\" data-href=\"Feathren - Traits#^39c1ee\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/01_pcs/singwin-mistwalker-folder/race-info/feathren-traits.html#^39c1ee\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Kindred Speech</a>) och vi (jag) förstår att den vill egentligen vara i skogen här jämte. Jag pratar lite mer till den och nämner att jag kan prata med <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"The King of Perk\" data-href=\"The King of Perk\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Kungen</a> åt den att den önskar lite mer frihet. Den verkar tycka om det. Sen visar den på lite olika sätt att den är hungrig och att den är dålig på att jaga. Säger att vi har en död Displacer Beast en kort bit bort och att Pocky får äta av den om hon hänger med oss sen. Det verkar hon tycka om också. Säger även att jag ska nämna detta till <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"The King of Perk\" data-href=\"The King of Perk\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Kungen</a> också, att den ska få lite mer spännande mat framöver.\nSen hänger den med oss tillbaks mot campet.På väg tillbaks så stannar Pocky plötsligt, tittar sig omkring och lyssnar, sen morrar/hissar åt träden och sen sticker hon. Vi hänger på. Vi hör sen att det är det där fnittrandet igen. Vi tar oss igenom utan att trigga fällor och sen in i campet.Prinsessan upptäcker oss strax efter att vi kommer in och rusar emot oss. Hon börjar klappa Pocky massor, men inte på ett bra eller skönt sätt för katten. Det ska jag minnas.<br>\nStrax därefter kommer <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"The King of Perk\" data-href=\"The King of Perk\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Kungen</a> efter att någon annan hämtade honom.\nHan tackar att vi kommer tillbaks efter ett lyckat uppdrag och är väldigt glad. Jag beklagar mig att jag är så ohövlig och inte har bugat och sen bugar jag.\nHan svarat att ”Nej nej!! Finns ingen mening med såna formaliteter!” Han tar sedan fram Corni Copia och frågar om någon av oss kan tänka sig ta emot äran och blåsa i den. Jag tog emot den men det var svårt att blåsa i den med näbb. Tony får den istället och den slänger spellen Hero’s Feast. Folk börjar samlas för att nu är det fest!<br>\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"The King of Perk\" data-href=\"The King of Perk\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Kungen</a> igen säger att vi måste göra det ett par gånger till för att alla ska få njuta av detta!Han bjuder med oss till bords jämte honom vid hans bord. Jag säger att jag pga min ras kan till viss del prata med kattdjur och fågeldjur.\nHan säger att det borde hjälpt när vi skulle hämtat Pocky.\nJajjemän säger jag. Jag säger också att jag fick lite önskemål om vad Pocky ville ha i livet.Vi sätter oss och jag berättar om det hon önskade.\nAlltså att hon ska få va i skogen mer och till o från, samt att hon ska få lite annan mat ibland, t.ex kött.Sen säger han att om vi har andra önskemål är de bara säga till. Jag nämner att de gärna får ge Tony en del vin. Vilket han löser. Det kommer mängder av vin från lite tjänare.\nTony svimmar av bara synen. Charmion kommer och häller vin i ansiktet på avsvimmade Tony så han vaknar. Sen fortsätter festandet. <br>Under festandet så börjar vi fundera. Det är så fridfullt och trevligt här. Varför skulle <a data-href=\"Gull’a\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/gull’a.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Gull’a</a> komma hit till denna platsen där det är mycket stoj och stim och liv?<br>Hilmia börjar fråga <a data-href=\"Charmion\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Charmion</a> lite om Hagga, Fey Wild mot Material Plane mm.Om det t.ex värms upp i Fey Wild, så blir det varmt på motsvarande plats i Material Plane.<br>\nVi frågar lite om <a data-href=\"Gull’a\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/gull’a.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Gull’a</a> och framförallt lite om hur hon kunde försvinna i det trädet. <a data-href=\"Charmion\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Charmion</a> föreslog att hon kan hjälpa oss kolla över det lite och kanske komma med lite tips och tankar. Blir lite fundersam på henne och försöka Insighta (21) henne, men det känns ok. Hon verkar seriös och på riktigt. Hon är väldigt övertalande, men verkar inte ha någon underliggande plan där. Hon frågar om vi inte kan prata om något trevligare. Så vi snackar lite annan gojja ett tag. Pipers’\nCharmion, Satyr\nSalmiel, Eladrin Elf\nCharmion och Tony börjar flörta med varandra nåt otroligt. Väldigt erotiskt.Efter en stund kommer Holger tillbaks och börjar skämta med oss fortsatt med ”-er, hardly know her!” skämt. Så vi alla utom Tony skrattar en hel del och Tony uttrycket att han känner sig utanför här då för att han inte kan språken vi pratar. Men lite mer skämt ensues och Tony blir lite ledsen och börjar gå iväg. Charmion ropar efter honom och säger till han att komma tillbaks och slänger nån magi för att lugna ner honom lite med.\nTony känner sig fortsatt utanför men mer fest och trevligheter fortsätter.Efter ett tag frågar Hilmia vart vi kunde sova nånstans. Kungen svarar och visar vart nånstans. Hilmia berättar för oss andra och sen går hon själv mot sin bädd.Cory frågar Kungen om de har någonstans man kan handla Potions i närheten. Han säger att nää det finns inte men det finns någon här som kanske kan hjälpa dig, och han pekar mot en person på ett bord en bit bort.Kvällningen kommer och vi ska börja dra oss mot bäddar. Tony börjar gå och Charmion säger att hon är inte säker på att hon kan hjälpa honom så han får sova ordentligt inatt. Tony säger att han bara behöver järnpulver så kan han lösa det själv. Charmion ger en vindruva till Holger och säger något till honom på Sylvan och han flyger iväg. Sen kommer han tillbaks och hon får en påse som hon ger till Tony. ”Det borde räcka för 3 nätter, det är pixie dust.”Jag frågar kungen lite om crafting. Och vi pratar lite. Sen går ja o lägger mig.\nCory går till potion-Harengon och pratar lite, försöker handla lite potions.Cory är nöjd sen och vill tacka kungen, så han går dit och säger tack. Varpå Kungen PROMPT berättar för Cory att det INTE är vettigt att gå runt och ”Tacka” folk hur som helst! Det medför att man är skyldig personen något. Kungen berättar också om att man INTE kan ge sitt namn till vem som helst för då kommer någon ta det från dig till slut.\nSedan går Cory och lägger sig också, efter att vi andra gjort det.När vi vaknar morgonen därpå hör vi en fana som väcker oss. Prinsessan, Kungen möter oss när vi vaknar och många från byn är också där och väntar.\nVi kommer ut och Prinsessan står jämte Kungen och håller fram en hatt som hon ber oss stoppa ner händerna i och ta upp var sin grej ur.\nJag fick en Pipa.\nDe berättar för oss att vi ska på ett Quest. Och om vi ska stå oss hela vägen så behöver vi var och en av dessa gåvor. Alla dessa har var sin spell på sig som kan slängas EN gång och sen tappar den sin förmåga.\nPipan har Etherealness\nTony fick ett klot med ??\nHilmia fick en kvist med ??\nCory fick en sko med ??","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#session"],"headers":[{"heading":"Session Summary","level":2,"id":"Session_Summary_0"},{"heading":"Recap of last session","level":2,"id":"Recap_of_last_session_0"},{"heading":"Log","level":2,"id":"Log_0"}],"links":[".html",".html","03_npcs/gull’a.html","03_npcs/gull’a.html","03_npcs/gull’a.html","01_pcs/singwin-mistwalker-folder/while-playing/items.html","03_npcs/gull’a.html","03_npcs/gull’a.html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html","01_pcs/singwin-mistwalker-folder/race-info/feathren-traits.html#^39c1ee",".html",".html",".html",".html","03_npcs/gull’a.html",".html","03_npcs/gull’a.html",".html"],"author":"Rasmus","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-33-2023-10-07.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":["02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-32-2023-10-01.html"],"createdTime":1730964968475,"modifiedTime":1696781225221,"sourceSize":18737,"sourcePath":"02_Journal/Thalbrine - Big campaign/Session 33 - 2023-10-07.md","exportPath":"02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-33-2023-10-07.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":212,"backlinks":["02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-34-2023-10-15.html"],"type":"markdown"},"02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-34-2023-10-15.html":{"title":"Session 34 - 2023-10-15","icon":"","description":"Session number: 58\nBörjade spela omkring: &lt;% tp.file.creation_date(HH:mm) %&gt;\nHitta ett sätt att få hem Holger\nFixa ett material med ursprung från the Astral Plane\nHälsa på Semil Wildmagic i Bastion Shore\nKomma på ett namn på byn där Cecil och Arvid finns Bruh\nVi springer igenom portalen och hamnar i The Fey Wild.

Det är många stora platåer, varpå vi står på en ganska liten. Platåerna är ihopkopplade med hängbroar. Vi stänger dörren bakom oss och går vidare, vi följer skon som hoppar vidare. Vi kommer till vad som verkar vara en liten by med identiska hus med identisk möblering. Till slut upptäcker jag att det känns som en spegelbild och det är ett hus som känns extra speciellt och framförallt mindre magiskt än de andra. Vi hoppar igenom fönstret och märker då att vi kommer till en annan version av samma värld. Vi går igenom och fortsätter följa skon som leder oss iväg vidare på broar och nya platåer med endast ett hus på varje. Skon hoppar vidare och vi följer den tills den stannar framför en dörr. Vi öppnar den och går igenom. Där kommer vi till ett helt annat landskap med stora stenhögar som ser ut som en bergskedja. Vi går efter skon en bit till, sen hör vi ett vrål från en sån flygande fyraarmad best vi såg i synen ett tag tidigare. Vi börjar smyga och gör det en bra bit. Vi upptäcker att vi är förföljda av ett pack med läskiga svarta, rödlysande vargar. Vi smyger på och till slut kommer vi till ett mindre hus, som står på två ben? Vi tar oss upp och in och möts där av Haggans illusioner och till slut svartnar allt och vi hamnar i nåt stenigt utrymme där Haggan väntar på oss. Hon är beskyddad av ett fält som en liten kub skapar. Vi diskuterar lite men känns som det inte kommer nån vart. Hilmia försvinner och kommer tillbaks, sen försvinner igen. Kort därefter börjar marken skaka och det låter som en mindre jordbävning. Haggan sticker och marken är helt sned och konstig men vi lyckas ta oss ut och jag får tag i kuben på vägen. Vi kommer upp och möter Hilmia. Vi hittar inte Haggan förrän hon börjar chanta och trolla fram en Horde med zombies som rör sig ganska snabbt emot oss. Utöver det kommer även packet med vargarna emot oss. Hilmia gör en grop som alla trillar ner i, men det kommer inte uppehålla dem länge. Vi har stora problem just nu.\nBruh\nPå andra sidan dörren är det som en annan värld. Det är många platåer framåt som alla har hängbroar till de olika platåerna. Den vi är på är väldigt smal till skillnad från de andra.\nPå platåerna finns hyddor. Runtom platåerna finns det flytande öar. Skon hoppar vidare.Vi ser att broarna är väldigt breda, antagligen breda nog för att kunna släppa fram häst med vagn. Repen på bron är knutna och typ intrasslade i stora rötter som kommer från platån. Vi stänger dörren bakom oss och vi börjar sedan gå, Tony först, sen skon, sen Cory, Jag och sist Hilmia. Ut på bron som är väldigt lång innan man når nästa platå. Det är ganska dött och typ öde här.\nVi funderar lite på om vi ska knacka på eller gå in i en av de flera dussinen stugor som är på platån vi kommit till. Platån är stor, säkert 200m bred. Tony kollar i en stuga men det fanns inget där i, kändes öde säger han.\nVi fortsätter följa skon. Skon går fram till mitten av lilla byn på denna platån. Den står verkligen i mitten av de tolv stugorna. Vi försöker hitta någon koppling till något. Cory går till en stuga men även den är tom och utan något i. Hittar inget av värde. Sen kollar de andra två också och försöker hitta något.\nHilmia upptäcker att alla husen och allt där i är identiskt. Under tiden står jag vid skon och kollar upp i himlen och där ser jag nån form av spegling av platån och där finns bara ett hus, inte 12 som vi har här.\nJag går runt och med Detect Magic försöker känna om det finns något hus som är mindre magiskt. Och det hittar jag. Jag berättar för de andra att jag såg något i himlen. De andra kollar och Tony ser också vad jag såg så vi kollar i det huset och försöker hitta något.Vi upptäcker att om vi flyttar på något i huset och går ut o sen in igen så har det vi flyttat på satt sig på sin originella position.\nVi provar lite till och sen provar vi en ny grej. Tony står utanför fönstret och kollar in i rummet, vi står i rummet och vi ser Tony, men Tony ser inte oss. Han öppnar fönstret men det öppnas inte för oss.\nHilmia råkar förstöra rutan inifrån och det förstörs inte för Tony.\nCory går ut och ser allt Tony upplever. Tony klättrar sen in igenom fönstret utifrån och kommer till ett tomt rum.\nJag klättrar ut ur fönstret, inifrån och kommer då till de andra, som jag såg men de såg ju inte oss. För dem ser det ut som att jag kommer från vatten som delas.Jag springer sen och hämtar skon och tar med den in till där Tony är och släpper den. Då börjar den hoppa en kort bit mot bron. Jag berättar för de andra och de hoppar igenom. Jag blir fundersam och provar springa tillbaks till där vi var förut och kolla ifall jag kan se de andra i himlen nu. Det kunde jag inte, men tror nu att det kanske handlar om Pocket Dimensions. Så börjar få lite hum om hur det funkar. Sen börjar vi följa skon och den leder oss upp till en bro där det finns en ensam stuga. Skon hoppar vidare förbi stugan och till nästa bro, mot nästa stuga. Och den fortsätter så förbi ett par stugor och platåer till, tills vi kommer till platå nummer 5. Där hoppar den mot en ensam dörr på stugan. Dörren är ett annat träslag än dörren vi kom hit igenom. Vi öppnar och går igenom.Det är kallt, väldigt kyligt och mörkare än tidigare. Vi ser höga kullar i sten som en bergskedja. Taggiga buskar och växter tränger sig igenom stenarna. Vi följer skon en bit och hör efter en stund ett ylande. Hilmia säger strax efter;\n”Vi är framme”.\nHon hänvisar till en fyra armad flygande best i luften, vilken jag såg i synen.\nDen ylar då och då. Verkar inte som att den följer eller jagar oss på nåt sätt.\nVi tänker att vi fortsätter gå, men smyger oss fram nu med hjälp av Pass Without Trace. Hilmia: ”Halv sova?”Det är väldigt ojämn terräng men vi följer den sakta framåt. Men hör ylande ibland fortfarande. När vi kommer upp en en lite högre mark sen så ser vi sen en bra bit fram, en stor stor hydda, som står på två stora ben i trä. Vi känner oss redo. Pratar lite med Holger om hur han känner kring att vi antagligen snart kommer attackera haggan.\nHolger berättar att han kanske kan hjälpa, han kan förvandla någon till en get säger han. Och att han kan andas ut en gas typ som kan uppehålla folk. Vi inspekterar huset lite och sen går vi framåt mot huset.\nVi kommer till en väg som är mellan bergen. Vägen har spår av hovar, vagn och mer vanliga fötter. Mycket sten är det på vägen och runtomkring med ganska lite jord. Vi hör ett ylande igen. Denna gången ganska nära, vi hör också ett flåsande så betydligt närmare än förut. Jag ber min griffon att hålla koll uppåt och bakåt under tiden vi fortsätter gå. Cory ber Holger att hålla lite koll. När vi gått en bit så säger griffonen till mig att han ser något. Bakom oss kommer det fram ett pack med svarta, lädriga djur med stora käkar och generellt stora djur kommer upp ovanför kullen.\nNär de andas så lyser deras bröstkorg upp i ett mörkrött sken, så mycket så vi kan se benen genom bröstkorgen.\nJag ser 7 stycken. Berättar detta för de andra. <img alt=\"BlackScaryWolfThatGlows.jpeg\" src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/monsters/blackscarywolfthatglows.jpeg\" target=\"_self\">Vi funderar på sätt vi kan bli av med dem och Cory slänger en sten en bra bit bort åt sidan och några av vargarna verkar röra sig dit han kastade. Vi fortsätter gå direkt.Vi kommer till en skylt där det står ”Travelers’, beware” i Sylvan berättar Holger. Vi upptäcker att på andra sidan skylten står det nån mer inbjudan, ”Travelers’, come and rest”.\nVi lyckas hålla bra avstånd från vargarna och vi kommer snart fram till huset. Benen som finns under huset har även tre tår, som håller fast i stenrubbel på marken.\nDen har en veranda typ som är 30ft upp, som är lite svår att ta sig till. Men Cory kan hoppa upp tror han, och sen ska han knyta ett rep till oss. Så han hoppar upp och sen fryser han till lite innan han knyter repet. Men sen gör han det och vi klättrar upp. Eller, vi försöker klättra upp. Hilmia klarar det inte. Men hon lyckas hålla fast så vi drar upp henne.\nSamtidigt ser vi att en av vargarna visar sig och rör sig mot oss. Dock verkar den inte kolla specifikt upp mot oss.Jag öppnar brevlådan som stod där men det var tomt. Den lät lite dock när man öppnade luckan.Vi alla känner att huset verkar röra sig. Det känns som det andas typ, sakta.\nVi öppnar dörren och börjar sakta gå inåt. Vi ser en eldstad, en matta med 2 fåtöljer på o lite annan dekoration. Det är väldigt rent och fint, bortsätt från vissa saker som är helt o rengjorda. Hyllor, vid fönsterna är inte alls städat.\nVid mattan finns det kroppsdelar som verkar stå uppställt som dekorationer. T.ex en hand står på bordet framför eldstaden. Vi ser en gungstol i ett mörkt mörkt hörn. Den gungar sakta och det sticker fram två ben och vi ser att det finns något leende som lyser. Vi säger lite saker mot figuren men får inget svar, den bara sitter kvar och gungar, med ett leende.\nTony går o petar lite i eldstaden. Sen diskuterar vi lite.\n”Hon vill nog att vi ska skjuta emot henne på stolen så träffar vi huset istället så det vaknar upp.” - Tony.\nTony börjar istället gå emot henne sakta och försiktigt. Haggan i stolen vrider sitt huvud mot Tony när han går. Sen petar han på den i stolen och den verkar verklig. Men den ger ingen respons. Han gör ett snitt på kinden, och då kommer det blod, svart blod. Sen petar han ut ögonen på den så hon inte ska kunna se oss. Fortfarande ingen respons. Det rinner blod och gojs nerför ansiktet, men det är fortfarande ett leende på läpparna.\nTony avslutar med att hugga huvudet av henne och sen kasta det i eldstaden. Hela tiden ett leende på läpparna tills hela huvudet är förkolnat och borta.”Ja den här måste ju ha vart fejk” säger Tony. Vi instämmer. ”Men väldigt obehaglig ändå” säger Tony.Vi samlas och går till en av de två innerdörrarna. Tony går först och öppnar och möts direkt av Haggan, utan leende. Hon rör sig direkt mot Tony och böjer sig ner och tar tag i dörrkarmen för att gå igenom. Hon går emot Tony medan vi alla backar. Hon följer efter. Tony stannar upp och hon börjar sträcka en arm emot Tony. Vi försöker slå bort den men vi lyckas inte. Den tar tag i Tony.\nAllt blir svart en kort stund. Sen blir det ljust igen och Haggan är borta. Vi vänder oss och upptäcker att Haggan är bakom Cory och tar tag honom om axeln och allt blir svart igen.\nDet blir ljus och golvplankorna delar på sig och upp kommer armar som klättrar upp lite och tar tag mig i benet. Allt blir svart igen. Och sen ljust. Vi ser mängder av Haggor i hela rummet. Alla rör sig mot oss. Jag tröttnar och slänger Dispel Magic och då försvinner hela rummet. Vi är i ett stenigt rum, en grotta utan utgångar och dörrar.\nVi ser bara två fåtöljer som innan, eldstaden och matta och ett bord.Sen ser vi även i hörnet där gungstolen vart tidigare står Haggan och typ chantar något, och håller en kub i handen. Samma som några av oss såg i grottan när vi slogs mot Poppy.\nTony går för attack och jag skjuter, men vi båda möts av en barriär och sen börjar hon prata med oss.Hon tycker att vi tog lång tid på oss att hitta henne. Men de tog även en bra stund för henne att fixa sina okulära problem som vi orsakade.\nHon tycker vi stressar så och är så otroligt på om att attackera hela tiden. ”Vill ni ha te?” Frågar hon. Diskussion fortgår. Hon frågar lite varför vi är här överhuvudtaget. ”Jag ville ha hit er av en anledning. Jag kände att när ni kom till detta planet så försvann ert beskydd som ni hade mot er curse. Så jag har ett erbjudande. Jag kan ta bort er curse, och ni blir skyldiga mig en gärning.”Vi fortsätter prata. Vi poängterar att vi inte vill ha någon deal. Men hon är lite sur på oss och försöker övertala oss. Hon vill inte heller lämna sin bubbla hon är i, för hon tänker hon kan vänta ut oss, vi kommer väl svälta ihjäl till slut.<br>\nJag slänger Dispel Magic igen, men det funkar inte, då jag inte kan komma åt källan för bubblan. Laddar sen upp en spell slot till med <a data-href=\"Rod of the Pactkeeper\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Rod of the Pactkeeper</a>.Tony går runt och letar kring och petar på saker och ting. Kroppsdelarna verkar ha känseln kvar och reagerar när Tony petar på dem.\nHilmia känner lite längsmed väggarna för o känna in stämningen.\nVi fortsätter bara leta runt. Hilmia upptäckte också att röken måste gå nånstans i eldstaden, där finns ett litet hål upp som verkar vara en skorsten.Cory klättrar upp på barriären, kupolen som skyddar henne. Hilmia blir till gas och flyger upp i skorstenen och letar runt lite. Vi verkar i alla fall vara i en källare under huset.Hilmia kommer ner efter en liten kik, pratar med Cory och sen drar hon upp igen som gas. Hon sticker ut och tänder eld i baken på huset. Lågan växer till sig och börjar brinna ordentligt.\nVi i källarn märker att Haggan blir irriterad och säger ”Den där irriterande…Jag är snart tillbaks.” och sen smälter hon in i väggen och försvinner. Hon springer ut och börjar släcka elden med nån magi. Hilmia blir gas igen och gömmer sig lite.\nEfter en stund får hon snilleblixten att använda sin magiska pinne hon fick. Mold Earth. Hon knuffar upp marken underifrån huset och det börjar luta och välta emot Haggan.Vi under marken börjar flytta på oss och taket börjar gå sönder och falla ner på oss. Marken under oss rör sig uppåt och börjar luta. Vi är fortfarande fast, nästan mer fast än innan. Huset är helt i spillror. Jag funderar, och tänker jag ska prova att Misty Step:a in i fältet. Och det fungerar. Jag tar sen upp kuben. Och hela fältet flyttar på sig, taket börjar krasa och spricka än mer. Försöker stänga av men det är massa knasiga knappar på den som jag inte vet hur de fungerar.\nBörjar gå runt längsmed motsatt vägg mot vart Cory och Tony befinner sig, så de kan gå igenom samma icke-vägg som Haggan gick igenom.\nDe lyckas gå igenom och jag försöker stänga av kuben, diskuterar lite med Bagge kring det men beslutar att lägga ner den i väskan och då verkar den stängas av. Hittar sen ett par potions, 3 av samma mystiska potion. Sen går jag också ut genom väggen och ser där en spegel som de andra nog redan gått igenom.\nVi krånglar sen ut ur det trasiga förstörda huset och möter Hilmia där. Vi har tagit en del skada från det fallna taket. Vi diskuterar lite och tänker sen försöka leta upp Haggan.\nHilmia reser upp marken igen där hon tror Haggan är och vi hör alla ett gällt skratt och sen försvinner det plötsligt. Hilmia sänker marken igen och vi försöker leta upp spår för vart hon kan tagit vägen. Tony rusar fram och försöker slå där hon står och Cory följer efter för att spåra lite. Han hittar spår och följer dem en bit och sen tar de slut. Efter en kort stund ser vi vargarna och de rör sig mot oss.\nVi ser även Haggan en bra bit bort göra nån form av magi och så ser vi sedan att hon summonar en horde med zombies från marken.\nHilmia sänker marken där vargarna är så de försvinner tillfälligt. Men de kanske kan klättra upp snart. Zombiesarna är ganska snabba också och rör sig mot oss kvickt.

Vi har provat Dispel Magic på väggen men funkade inte. Vi pratar med Haggan och försöker deala något. Efter mycket om och men så kommer vi överens om Challenges/utmaningar. Vi ska göra 3 stycken och då får vi lite belöningar i form av att få komma ur källaren respektive hon ska tvingas lämna sitt hem i vårt Plan och hon ska ge oss en utväg ut från The Feywilds. För varje utmaning vi misslyckas med får hon ta valfri ägodel från oss. Vi klarade alla tre utmaningar och avslutade med att döda henne då hon försökt lura oss igen. Vi tar oss ut och inser att skölden/skyddet vi hade mot Cursen är borta, vi börjar må dåligt igen. Vi tar oss ut och Tony mha Lamal tar oss till ett tempel. Där vill Lamal göra Tony till en av sina krigare, men Tony har ångrat sig och vill inte det. Under natten har Tony massa mardrömmar och bestämmer sig för att avsluta sitt liv under morgonen. Hilmia hinner som tur är komma och rädda honom. Vi drar sedan vidare och <a data-href=\"Irago\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Irago</a> pekar oss åt en riktning där en Order av Bloodhunters befinner sig, men han avskyr dem så han vill inte hänga med.<br>\nVi hittar dit och efter lite krångel så träffar vi <a data-href=\"Sol\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Sol</a> som hjälper oss att inte bli avrättade. Han leder oss till <a data-href=\"Ibrahim\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ibrahim</a>, någon högt uppsatt inom deras Order. Han säger följande kring vår curse Vi berättar om cursen och han får känna av oss lite. Han kan inte hjälpa oss, men han vet någon som kan.\nOm ni går 4 dagar och 4 nätter i sandstormen. Om ni svälter. Om ni bönar och ber. Och ni har turen att någon uppmärksammar er, så kan ni bli sedda av de mörka magikerna. Då kan ni bli ledda till den undangömda platsen, bakom synvillan. Det är ingen plats man går till, det är en plats man dör för.\nNi måste dö för öknen. Sen pratar han med Tony och att han är förföljd fortfarande av Yormund. Han berättar om en ritual som kan rensa allt, men det är få som påbörjat ritualen och än färre som överlevt den. Tony vill göra den och när vi pratat klart leds Tony ner till ritualrummet och där påbörjas den. Tony under ritualen dör och återuppstår, blir pånyttfödd. Han har i och med ritualen blivit av med cursen, och allt annat som höll han bunden.\nPå andra sidan dörren är det som en annan värld. Det är många stora platåer, varpå vi står på en ganska liten. Platåerna är ihopkopplade med hängbroar. Vi stänger dörren bakom oss och går vidare, vi följer skon som hoppar vidare. Vi kommer till vad som verkar vara en liten by med identiska hus med identisk möblering. Till slut upptäcker jag att det känns som en spegelbild och det är ett hus som känns extra speciellt och framförallt mindre magiskt än de andra. Vi hoppar igenom fönstret och märker då att vi kommer till en annan version av samma värld. Vi går igenom och fortsätter följa skon som leder oss iväg vidare på broar och nya platåer med endast ett hus på varje. Skon hoppar vidare och vi följer den tills den stannar framför en dörr. Vi öppnar den och går igenom. Där kommer vi till ett helt annat landskap med stora stenhögar som ser ut som en bergskedja. Vi går efter skon en bit till, sen hör vi ett vrål från en sån flygande fyraarmad best vi såg i synen ett tag tidigare. Vi börjar smyga och gör det en bra bit. Vi upptäcker att vi är förföljda av ett pack med läskiga svarta, rödlysande vargar. Vi smyger på och till slut kommer vi till ett mindre hus, som står på två ben? Vi tar oss upp och in och möts där av Haggans illusioner och till slut svartnar allt och vi hamnar i nåt stenigt utrymme där Haggan väntar på oss. Hon är beskyddad av ett fält som en liten kub skapar. Vi diskuterar lite men känns som det inte kommer nån vart. Hilmia försvinner och kommer tillbaks, sen försvinner igen. Kort därefter börjar marken skaka och det låter som en mindre jordbävning. Haggan sticker och marken är helt sned och konstig men vi lyckas ta oss ut och jag får tag i kuben på vägen. Vi kommer upp och möter Hilmia. Vi hittar inte Haggan förrän hon börjar chanta och trolla fram en Horde med zombies som rör sig ganska snabbt emot oss. Utöver det kommer även packet med vargarna emot oss. Hilmia gör en grop som alla trillar ner i, men det kommer inte uppehålla dem länge. Vi har stora problem just nu.\nVi spolar tillbaks till när vi är i källaren och Hilmia har gasat sig upp i skorstenen. Jag har precis provat att använda Dispel Magic på väggen och laddat upp en Spell Slot med Rod of the Pact Keeper. Vi försöker konversera lite med henne. Tony försöker få lite info från henne. Han vill ha potionen som hon brygger. Han erbjuder en Tigersten vilket hon tycker bara ser ut som en vanlig sten som bara är målad.\nPlötsligt ser vi hur gas en bit bakom Haggan kondenseras till en liten apa. Apan sätter sig på bordet där kuben är och den tar upp den och sen börjar gå iväg mot väggen bakom Haggan.\nHaggan upptäcker att något är fel och vänder sig och går mot Apan, de försvinner in i väggen och sen kommer de båda tillbaks, med kuben i Haggans händer. Hon ställer tillbaks den på bordet och sätter apan på en stol. Sen fortsätter Tony försöka tradea vår frihet från huset med något. Fortsatt diskussion sker. Jag skickar under tiden Message till Hilmia-apan och säger att om Haggan försvinner en minut så kan jag kanske hoppa in och fixa kuben, hon svarade att hon ska försöka.Diskussioner fortsätter. Hilmia förvandlar sig tillbaks till sitt vanliga jag.\nHon försöker ta reda på vad vi önskar och vill, och hon förstår inte varför vi inte skulle vilja komma hem. Och inte heller varför vi är efter henne.Vi nämner utmaningar/challenges.\nHon verkar nappa på det.\n3 challenges. Om vi klarar en så får vi gå ut, klarar vi 2 så överger hon sitt hem på vårt plan, klarar vi 3 så hjälper hon oss tillbaks till vårt plan.\nOm vi misslyckas, så får hon ta valfri PRYL hon vill ha från oss.Vi accepterar och hon tar med oss till vardagsrummet i huset.Make something prettier, than me.\nCory börjar sketcha. Tony börjar också sketcha.\nJag och Hilmia försöker hitta på nåt annat. Vi lyckas få fram en spegel genom att jag tar fram EverIce Box och häller ut lite vatten på bordet. Hon kollar sig i spegeln men säger att det bara är hon i spegelbilden, trots att Hilmia har målat lite på henne.\nDe visar målningarna för henne men hon nekar dem bara. Jag frågar sen Bagge om han har någon tanke. Han säger att han själv är vackrare än henne, kolla bara på stygnen. Jag försöker övertala Haggan om detta men hon hänger inte på. Hon bara säger att det kanske blir väskan som hon tar av oss sen.Vi försöker komma på nåt men har skitsvårt. Tony har ritat klart sin andra målning som är en sketch av en av hennes systrar. Linus rollar nat 20 på det i Deception. Jacob rollar också Nat20. Efter mycket om och men, diskussioner och annat. Till slut säger Cory som blivit hintad från Holger; ”Här. Detta är vackrare än du” och så visar han ett tomt blad i sin anteckningsbok. ”Du sa att INGET är vackrare än du och här är INGET”.\nHon accepterar detta.”Your next challenge is to bring me a palace”\nJag tipsar Cory om att måla ett palats i sin bok. Det funkade inte. ”You brought me an IMAGE of a palace, i want a palace”.Hilmia börjar skapa ett palats i sand/jord.\nNär hon 10 minuter senare är klar så blir Haggan överväldigad över palatset som uppkommit från ingenting. ”HOW did you DO that?” säger hon och börjar röra sig mot Hilmia och Hilmia säger ”nej det får du inte”. Hon blir sur och fortsätter till nästa del.”This last part, is a test of strength. Show me you can defeat a 100 warriors and I will take you home for free”\nHon börjar chanta och hälla ut potions på marken. Efter en stund så öppnas en port i marken där det kryper upp Wraiths.\n”So. Show me your strength” säger hon och sen skickar hon dem mot oss. De rör sig ganska fort men inte springande fort.\nTony går framåt en liten bit och sen tar han upp en kristallkula och slänger nån magi från den. Alla fryses fast. ALLA Wraiths blir till is.\nÄven Haggan bakom dem har frusit fast sina ben i marken. ”Har de dött?” frågar Hilmia?\nJag börjar skjuta dem och alla bara exploderar.\nVi plöjer oss igenom och kommer till slut till Haggan.\nHon tar sig loss och säger ”I will show you the way home, when you can find me” och hon försvinner.\nJag använder mitt item jag fick som har Etherealness. Jag försvinner och ser henne direkt, hon lyser i nåt vitt ljus. Jag följer efter tätt inpå. Till slut ett par hundra meter från där hon försvann, stannar hon. Hon sätter sig och börjar gräva i en liten pouch hon har och hittar en potion. Medan hon läser på den så skjuter jag Eldritch Blast bara några centimeter från potionen. 3 hits varav 1 crit.\nHela hennes underarm exploderar och hon vrålar något djuriskt. ”Do you know the pain you’ve caused me?”\n”I will show you the way home. We need to go to the mirror” säger hon.\nJag och hon börjar gå och hon går först. Till slut möter vi upp de andra och vi går tillsammans till hennes hus och letar upp en spegel. Hon ber oss hämta en nyckel för spegeln i byrålådan. Hilmia hämtar och det är en hand med någon magi i. Den får vi använda för att ta oss hem.<br>Cory tar upp det här med <a data-href=\"Alham &amp; Doni\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/alham-&amp;-doni.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Alham &amp; Doni</a>, och att vi vill ha Doni’s skalle. Hon säger att den är i källaren. Vi tänker avsluta konversationen men Tony avslutar Haggans liv istället. Hon säger att ”I didn’t expect anything else. But since you haven’t held up your end of the bargain and leave, I will take something that’s yours” säger hon och tar tag i svärdet och kör det längre in i kroppen. Sen viker hon sig ner på marken och försvinner. Tillsammans med svärdet. Tony blir förtvivlad.\nJag frågar Bagge vart en sån kan ta vägen och han svarar att det kan vara en pocket dimension. Jag försöker känna efter och känner direkt att det finns en här i närheten. Vi börjar leta och Hilmia hittar en under Haggans kläder.\nJag får den och ser direkt att det är en sån. Jag stoppar ner handen men något biter mig.\nTony tar den och kör ner handen. Han blir inte biten och lyckas få tag i ett par potions och sitt svärd! Men han tar tag i själva bladet och skär sig på kuppen.Efter det försöker Hilmia leta upp kuben och Doni’s skalle nere i källaren. Hon hittar en skalle, men den pratar inte. Men inte kuben.\nSen kommer hon upp igen och vi pratar lite sen fortsätter hon leta efter kuben i huset. Vi letar sen fortsatt efter kuben i Pocket Hålet men vi hittar inget.\nEfter en stund så tröttnar vi och öppnar istället en portal tillbaks hem i spegeln med hjälp av handen. Vi går igenom.Vi kommer tillbaks till en plats vi känner igen, i en tunnel av sten.\nDet är helt tyst. Inte ett ljud, en blåst, något annat.\nVi känner efter bara ett steg, en ny tyngd i bröstet. Som innan vi fick ett skydd från Antek.\nVi ser inristningar och skulpturer på väggarna medan vi går. Som verkar symbolisera massor av olika personer. Det är nån form av händelseförlopp som är lite svårförståeligt. Det står saker i Rakash, men vi kan inte läsa det.<br>\nTill slut känner vi igen en figur. Gamhuvud med sfinxben. Det är <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Saxicus\" data-href=\"Saxicus\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/saxicus.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Irago</a>.Tony hör röster i Rakash och sen när han öppnar ögonen så lyser texterna som står på väggarna. Och han kan läsa dem.\n2 Lizards, 1 Feathren, 3 Humans, 1 Alv.\nDore, Irire, Rinir, Eriro, Herod, Milon, Irago.\nFinns en 8:e figur med vitt ansikte. ”Praise be, His name eternal, Lamal”\nDet är inristat hur var och en av dem har fallit. Men det är en kvar som inte har sin sista text inskriven.\nTony kommer till slut till en text som inte passar in. Är nästan som en vers.Tony går sen till andra väggen och försöker tolka vad som hänt där. Mycket mer ritualer, exorcismer. Hilmia känner med marken och det känns tomt.När vi börjar gå så frågar jag partyt om åsikt att förstöra spegeln.\nSen börjar vi gå. Vi stannar sen där vi hittade Alham. Och vi hjälper Doni att komma till efterlivet. Vi går sen vidare igen. Och tillslut kommer vi till den stora sandhögen där vi klättrade ner. Vi klättrar upp och börjar röra oss norrut.\nJag ropar flertalet gånger efter Irago under tiden vi går.\nDet börjar bli kvällning och vi inser att vi behöver stanna och även att de få rations vi har kvar är dåliga.\nHolger kryper upp ur väskan och klagar lite på att det är kallt här. Cory hade ju sagt att det skulle vara varmt!Tony börjar efter en stund ställa sig upp och leta efter nåt. Han säger att han hört viskningar som ber han att ”följ mitt ljus”.\nVi letar men hittar inget. Vi provar lite saker min inget funkar.\nTill slut stänger Tony ögonen på Hilmias begäran och känna efter. Då börjar han se och känna saker, fast stängda ögon. Han öppnar ögonen och ser något spår som lyser framåt.\nHan säger att han ser något till oss och att vi behöver gå nu, på natten.\nVi går med, men trotsar lite då vi behöver sova nån gång. Till slut stannar Tony, för spåret har stannat säger han. Det bara tar slut. Vi letar efter något men vi hittar ingenting speciellt här.\nHilmia säger att området känns försvarat, skyddat. Det känns tydligen lite på samma sätt som i soltemplet, fast under sanden här.\nJag börjar blåsa bort sand med Gust för att se om vi kan hitta något. Efter en bra stund ser vi en figur gåendes mot oss, väldigt sakta. En brun hatt, en näbb, en lång poncho. Det måste vara Irago. Jag fortsätter blåsa sand tills han kommer, men hittar ingenting.<br>När <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Saxicus\" data-href=\"Saxicus\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/saxicus.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Irago</a> kommer så säger han ”du har gjort uppdraget?” Tony svarar ja.\n”Då så. Är du redo?” I samband med det slänger han Moonbeam och lyser över arean vi står vid. Då plötsligt i månljuset börjar ett tempel komma fram.\nNär Tony accepterar att han är redo så går vi alla med Irago upp in i templet.Vi möts där inne av en Avatar av Lamal. Lysande och ljus. Med starkt månljus lysande genom ett hål i taket.\n”Are you ready to give your life?” säger Avataren. Tony säger ingenting men det fortsätter.\nHan beds sätta sig på knä och lägga ned sitt svärd. Vilket han gör.\nAvataren ber sedan Tony att lämna sitt liv och i för att göra det säga orden efter Avataren. Han gör det, de första två meningarna, men sen känner han inte med längre. Och han säger att han inte tänker göra detta, han vill inte ha någon som bestämmer vad han ska göra med sitt liv. Han vill bestämma sitt eget öde. Avataren blir lite sur men accepterar detta då Tonys liv inte har blivit Lamals än.Irago kommer fram när Tony ställer sig upp och frågar vad han håller på med. Tony säger samma sak igen, han vill inte ha någon herre över sig.Irago tycker vi ser trötta ut, mer än energimässigt. Jag berättar att vi har tappat vårt skydd som vi hade tidigare. Han säger att han ska fortsatt hjälpa oss. Han ska imorgon ta oss till en dold order. En order av Blood Hunters. Tills dess får vi sova, och det i Lamals tempel. Vi får berättat att Tonys svärd blev Blessed av Lamal. Men utöver det är Tony Klasslös. Han tillhör ingen klass. När vi vaknar så är inte Tony kvar där vi sov. Hilmia går ut först, ett tag efter kommer jag och Cory.\nTony sitter i mitten av templet på knä med sitt svärd stucket i sig själv. Hilmia rusar dit så fort hon ser och försöker hjälpa och hela honom.\nNär vi kommer in så ser vi honom och springer fram också. Vi ser att han andas och är levande men svag och typ halvt döende.\nHan vaknar till ordentligt efter en kort stund och börjar prata lite. Han säger att han behövde göra detta. Han drömde mardrömmar under natten och valde att ta sitt liv för att bli fri. Han säger att han är fri från Yormund och från Lamal. Han dras inte längre mellan dem båda.Irago kommer för att hämta oss så resan kan börja. Vi gör oss redo och går sedan ut och möter honom. ”När vi kommer nära deras sanctum. Så kommer jag att lämna er och förhoppningsvis slipper jag prata med någon. Jag avskyr hela bunten” säger Irago.\n”För att…?” säger Hilmia.\n”Det hinner jag inte prata om på de.. 3 dagarna vi har att resa dit”.”Ni har gjort mig och Lamal en stor tjänst. Inte bara oss, livet här kommer förbättras med tiden när hennes mörka närvaro är borta. Ni kanske aldrig kommer märka av det, men det är mindre, axlar, att lätta från deras bördor.”Vi färdas i tre dagar. ”Håll era garder uppe. De är inte vänliga när man först träffar dem” säger Irago och går åt ett annat håll.\nHilmia pratar lite med Tony om vad han har varit med om. Tony säger sen att ”Ni är min familj, ni betyder allt för mig.”\nVi andra håller med.Vi går vidare sen mot den riktning som Irago gav oss.\nEfter ett tag senare ser vi en tiger eller ett lejon gjort av sand som rider emot oss. Ovanpå sitter en vitklädd figur. Den stannar 100ft eller nåt bort. Vi stannar upp och låter den kolla in oss. Vi ropar till den att vi inte vill något ont och blivit rekommenderade att komma hit. Figuren försvinner efter en stund bakom en pelare och kommer inte fram nån annanstans. Vi fortsätter gå. Cory och Hilmia säger att vi är övervakade och de tror vi går in i ett bakhåll.\nEfter kort stund möts vi av flera vitklädda figurer som små-attackerar oss. De slänger en curse på Tony. Och förbereder attacker emot oss andra.\nVi ropar lite och försöker få dem att stoppa attacker emot oss.\nDe börjar prata lite på Rakash tror vi. Sen börjar en av dem prata med oss på Common. De frågar varför vi är här. De accepterar inte helt vår anledning. Vi fortsätter försöka förklara. Kort efter vi börjat prata så kommer en annan snubbe med lite mörkare och grövre röst övertala sina kumpaner att släppa oss. Han pratar lite med dem och de drar iväg. Han pratar lite med Tony på Rakash och sen säger han på Common; ”Kom, ni är nu mina gäster..” Han ber oss gå med honom, vilket vi gör.<br>\nHan frågar varför vi är här, och vi berättar lite om Cursen o så. Han säger då att han är expert på förbannelser, men det finns en som är ännu bättre på dem, <a data-href=\"Ibrahim\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ibrahim</a>. Och han ska leda oss till honom. <a data-href=\"Sol\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Sol</a> heter han som hjälper oss nu, vilken vi har träffat tidigare i Karats tempel.Sol frågar oss mer sen lite om vad vi gjort sen vi träffade honom sist.\nJag berättar lite om Mar-Dekesh, att vi vart i Lamals Shrine och jagat en Hagga till Feywilds och sen letat efter henne där och oskadliggört henne.<br>\nHan avbryter oss och säger ”Snälla, vad hette denna Haggan?”. ”<a data-href=\"Gull’a\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/gull’a.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Gull’a</a>” säger jag.\nHan svarar ”Ni är en gåva från Karat. Karat skyddar på eran väg”.Han berättar att vi INTE är välkomna har egentligen. Men vi är hans gäster så ingen kommer göra något mot oss. Om vi bara berättar vad för gärningar vi gjort för dem så kommer Ibrahim hjälpa oss säger han. Jag har identifierat resten av potionsarna (förutom Hilmias 2).\nTotalt; Potion of Climbing, Potion of Giant Strength (Frost Giant, Rare), Potion of Clairvoyance, Potion of Poison (ser ut som health potion).Vi leds fram till nåt litet tempel typ. Sol leder oss in och säger till oss att vi kommer behöva ge lite blod till Ibrahim. Sen stänger han dörrarna och vi ser bara mörket och två röda ögon. Ibrahim börjar prata med oss. Han ber oss gå fram. Vi går fram och sätter oss. Han ber oss bevisa att vi haft ihjäl Haggan. Vi visar Holger. Ibrahim pratar lite med Holger och får genom honom veta att Haggan är död, vilket räcker som bevis säger han.\nSen går han till oss. Vi berättar om cursen och han får känna av oss lite. Han kan inte hjälpa oss, men han vet någon som kan.\nOm ni går 4 dagar och 4 nätter i sandstormen. Om ni svälter. Om ni bönar och ber. Och ni har turen att någon uppmärksammar er, så kan ni bli sedda av de mörka magikerna. Då kan ni bli ledda till den undangömda platsen, bakom synvillan. Det är ingen plats man går till, det är en plats man dör för.\nNi måste dö för öknen.\nMen ni har ett mer brådskande problem. Ni är förföljda, Tony är förföljd. Ditt band är inte helt brutit mot Yormund ännu. Du har fortfarande din märkning kvar. Han fortsätter sedan en monolog till Tony om hans problem med band, Blood Hunter, bundenhet osv.”The first step of course, is to sever your hand” - Ibrahim till Tony om ritualen han behöver göra.Haggan ber Ibrahim kolla också. Han tar lite blod från henne och säger ”Min vän, du är inte hel, du saknar en del. Du saknar en del av din själ. Den är delad i 3. Du har bara en tredjedel. Din historia och din framtid saknas. Hitta dem och du kommer bli hel.””Min vän, mitt barn. Jag hade kunnat lukta på ditt blod för evigt, det finns så många hemligheter” - Ibrahim till Hilmia”Om ni möter honom igen, om ni törs. Fråga honom om ’Rathola’. En by som inte längre finns. Vad hände med dem, 254 själarna? Det finns ingen han inte offrar för balansen. Gå..” säger Ibrahim angående IragoVi går sen ut där Sol möter oss. Tony ber han visa vägen till altaret där han ska göra ritualen. Han leder oss ner dit. Vi kommer till ett metallstängsel där Sol ber Tony gå in. Han berättar att det är väldigt få som gör denna ritual, och det är än färre som överlever den. Han säger att det är en fruktansvärd, outhärdlig ritual. När Tony gått in så låser Sol stängslet.\nSol ber oss hänga med honom upp, långt bort från rummet där Tony utför ritualen, då det inte kommer vara en trevlig upplevelse att vara i närheten av. Hilmia önskar stanna. Hon sätter sig utanför och chantar under hela ritualen.Till slut en bra stund senare kommer Tony tillbaks, iklädd endast helt nerblodade tygstycken. Ritualen började med att Tony lägger sig, naken, på ett stenbord. Efter det hugger av sig sin vänstra hand. I ritualen behöver han tömma sin kropp på allt blod han har i kroppen. Och under en halvtimme ligger han och kippar efter luft, bara precis tillräckligt för att huvudet ska fortsätta vara igång.\nEfter ritualen är Tony pånyttfödd. Han är en Unshackled Blood Hunter. Hans hjärta och kropp är återställda. Till och med Cursen vi har på oss är borta.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#session"],"headers":[{"heading":"Current agenda","level":1,"id":"Current_agenda_0"},{"heading":"Goals","level":7,"id":"Goals_0"},{"heading":"Session Summary","level":1,"id":"Session_Summary_0"},{"heading":"Recap of last session","level":1,"id":"Recap_of_last_session_0"},{"heading":"Log","level":1,"id":"Log_0"},{"heading":"RETCON","level":3,"id":"RETCON_0"},{"heading":"Igång på riktigt","level":3,"id":"Igång_på_riktigt_0"},{"heading":"Challenge 1","level":3,"id":"Challenge_1_0"},{"heading":"Challenge 2","level":3,"id":"Challenge_2_0"},{"heading":"Challenge 3","level":3,"id":"Challenge_3_0"},{"heading":"Tillbaks i Shrivell’s Reach","level":3,"id":"Tillbaks_i_Shrivell’s_Reach_0"}],"links":[".html",".html",".html","03_npcs/alham-&-doni.html","03_npcs/saxicus.html","03_npcs/saxicus.html",".html",".html","03_npcs/gull’a.html"],"author":"Rasmus","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-36-2023-11-03.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":["05_quests/current-goals-singwin-mistforger.md","02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-36-2023-11-03.html","02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-35-2023-10-23.html"],"createdTime":1730964969039,"modifiedTime":1731699500918,"sourceSize":20884,"sourcePath":"02_Journal/Thalbrine - Big campaign/Session 36 - 2023-11-03.md","exportPath":"02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-36-2023-11-03.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":215,"backlinks":["02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-36-2023-11-03.html","02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-37-2023-11-26.html"],"type":"markdown"},"02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-37-2023-11-26.html":{"title":"Session 37 - 2023-11-26","icon":"","description":"Session number: 58\nBörjade spela omkring: 16:42\nHitta ett sätt att få hem Holger\nFixa ett material med ursprung från the Astral Plane\nHälsa på Semil Wildmagic i Bastion Shore\nKomma på ett namn på byn där Cecil och Arvid finns Vi går och svälter i öknen. Vi träffar ett par zombie-monster typ som vi har ihjäl. Vi fortsätter svälta och sen efter ett tag kommer vi fram till en stor staty och jämte står en tiger med händerna på fel arm(handflatan utåt och tummarna nedåt). Vi pratar med honom och när han börjar lita på oss så tar han med oss till sitt hem typ, där vi får äta hur mycke mat vi vill, om vi gör en tjänst för honom efter vi ätit. Vi går med på det och äter så mycket vi bara kan. Han visar oss sedan ut ur byggnaden och då ser vi att vi är högt uppe i en flygande stad ovanför molning. <a data-href=\"Maraja\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/04_places/shrivell's-reach/maraja.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Maraja</a>\n<br>RETCON: Vi är tillbaks i källaren och har bara varit där en kort stund. Vi har provat Dispel Magic på väggen men funkade inte. Vi pratar med Haggan och försöker deala något. Efter mycket om och men så kommer vi överens om Challenges/utmaningar. Vi ska göra 3 stycken och då får vi lite belöningar i form av att få komma ur källaren respektive hon ska tvingas lämna sitt hem i vårt Plan och hon ska ge oss en utväg ut från The Feywilds. För varje utmaning vi misslyckas med får hon ta valfri ägodel från oss. Vi klarade alla tre utmaningar och avslutade med att döda henne då hon försökt lura oss igen. Vi tar oss ut och inser att skölden/skyddet vi hade mot Cursen är borta, vi börjar må dåligt igen. Vi tar oss ut och Tony mha Lamal tar oss till ett tempel. Där vill Lamal göra Tony till en av sina krigare, men Tony har ångrat sig och vill inte det. Under natten har Tony massa mardrömmar och bestämmer sig för att avsluta sitt liv under morgonen. Hilmia hinner som tur är komma och rädda honom. Vi drar sedan vidare och <a data-href=\"Irago\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Irago</a> pekar oss åt en riktning där en Order av Bloodhunters befinner sig, men han avskyr dem så han vill inte hänga med.<br>\nVi hittar dit och efter lite krångel så träffar vi <a data-href=\"Sol\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Sol</a> som hjälper oss att inte bli avrättade. Han leder oss till <a data-href=\"Ibrahim\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ibrahim</a>, någon högt uppsatt inom deras Order. Han säger följande kring vår curse Vi berättar om cursen och han får känna av oss lite. Han kan inte hjälpa oss, men han vet någon som kan.\nOm ni går 4 dagar och 4 nätter i sandstormen. Om ni svälter. Om ni bönar och ber. Och ni har turen att någon uppmärksammar er, så kan ni bli sedda av de mörka magikerna. Då kan ni bli ledda till den undangömda platsen, bakom synvillan. Det är ingen plats man går till, det är en plats man dör för.\nNi måste dö för öknen. Sen pratar han med Tony och att han är förföljd fortfarande av Yormund. Han berättar om en ritual som kan rensa allt, men det är få som påbörjat ritualen och än färre som överlevt den. Tony vill göra den och när vi pratat klart leds Tony ner till ritualrummet och där påbörjas den. Tony under ritualen dör och återuppstår, blir pånyttfödd. Han har i och med ritualen blivit av med cursen, och allt annat som höll han bunden.\nRitualen är klar. Hilmia kommer upp till oss och berättar att Tony är tillbaks och att Sol får komma och låsa upp.\nSol sträcker fram nyckeln till Hilmia och säger ”Se till att det är Tony som kommit, det finns en risk att det inte är er vän som kommit tillbaks”\nHilmia går ner och kommer tillbaks igen tillsammans med Tony.\nHan säger att det har gått bra, han är fri.<br>Vi funderar lite på vad vi ska göra nu. Vi fick ju ett uppdrag typ från <a data-href=\"Ibrahim\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ibrahim</a> som innebar att vi skulle komma till de <a data-href=\"Mörka Magikerna\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mörka Magikerna</a>, genom att dö för öknen. Vi är lite osäkra på det, för vi vill inte dö. <br>Jag frågar <a data-href=\"Sol\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Sol</a> efter en stund vilket håll vi ska gå. Han säger, nordväst och pekar på vår karta. Efter en kort stund så går vi iväg, <a data-href=\"Sol\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Sol</a> följer oss iväg. Efter en kort stund möter vi med de som vi mötte tidigare innan <a data-href=\"Sol\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Sol</a> kom till oss och ledde oss vidare. De pratar lite på Rakash och sen leds vi vidare av Sol. Han trollar fram sin stora sandkatt när vi kommer ut och vi går.<br>\nVi följer floden som är en bit bort och efter ett tag bryter vi ifrån den och går åt ett annat håll. Det börjar bli kvällning och vi stannar till och tänder en brasa. Vi äter lite, och då säger <a data-href=\"Sol\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Sol</a>, att frukosten imorn är vår sista måltid.\n”Efter ni ätit, måste ni slänga all mat och allt vatten ni har”.”Dessa mörka magiker har, astronomi???. De bor uppe i himlen typ. De ser landet under dem, denna enorma öken. Till och från skickar de ner sina undersåtar hit för träning, jakt eller annat. Det är ett avstängt samhälle där de lever.\nOm de ska vara intresserade nog att ta med er till sitt hem, innanför dess portar, så måste ni visa hängivenhet, villiga att offra allt för att komma in. Endast då, visar de kanske sin barmhärtighet och hämtar in er.”<br>”Ni är en konstig skara, ni har lyckats med mycket på kort tid. Jag tror ni har en stor chans” säger <a data-href=\"Sol\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Sol</a>Hilmia frågar om varför de kallas för de mörka magikerna.\nDe kallas det för det var de som vände sig till de mörka krafterna; nekromanti, blodsmagi o liknande.<br><a data-href=\"Sol\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Sol</a> berättar efter en stund att han en gång har sett en Golem. En stor figur gjord av sten, med rustning och vapen. Om ni träffar på en sån; om den låter er vara, låt den vara också. Det är en onödig fight.\n”När ni väl är där, förvänta er inte någon mottagning. Ni kommer nog bara få passage till staden. Ni får skaffa era egna kontakter. Gör utbyten, små uppdrag med dem för att få något. Gå inte in för fight först. Men va på er vakt, vissa kanske gärna tar era prylar från era kalla, döda händer.<br><a data-href=\"Sol\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Sol</a> sitter skräddare. Han verkar vara ganska vig.Cory frågar lite hur Holger mår och berättar att vi ska typ svälta ihjäl framöver. Han tycker det känns ok.Vi sover, sen äter frukost och tömmer ur all mat o vatten vi har. Tony dricker upp en hel flaska vin under frukosten, för att inte vaska.\nJag häller ur vattnet ur Everice Box och slänger iväg te-flaskan.\nSen börjar vi gå.<br>Vi går en bra stund sen stannar <a data-href=\"Sol\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Sol</a> oss och pekar åt en riktning o säger ”Ditåt. Där är mitten på öknen. Där är störst chans att de ska se er. Lycka till”\nSen drar han iväg.Värmevågorna får synen att vika. Vår blessing hjälper fortfarande. Vi alla känner att det är en mycket tyngre atmosfär här än vad det varit tidigare när vi gått omkring.\nEfter en halv dag ungefär ser Tony en hägring och han stannar upp. Tar upp något från marken. Han tror det är en svamp. Hilmia kollar också på den men är osäker. Cory kollar också och ser att det är kött, gammalt ruttet kött. Han tror det kan vara från någon odöd. Han slänger iväg den och sen går vi vidare. Hilmia ber oss stanna efter en stund och hon sätter sig ner och försöker känna in öknen lite. Det känns nästan som att magikerna har skapat denna platsen. Den känns inte äkta, på riktigt. När hon funderat klart så går vi vidare.Tony ƒunderar lite efter en ny plats han kan skära sig på då han nu saknar sin vänsterhand, efter en stund ser han nåt på marken. Det var en till bit med ruttet kött.En hel dag har gått, kvällningen börjar komma. Vi funderar på att gå under natten istället för att sova. Efter natten får vi En nivå av ExhaustionEfter ett till dygn utan sömn känner vi verkligen att vi behöver vila. Men vi övertalar varandra att det är lika bra att vi går så vi kommer fram fortare. Vi pressar på, men efter inte ens en timme så däckar jag, på grund av trötthet.\nDe försöker bära mig men de orkar inte. Hilmia försöker väcka mig med en riktigt sunkig doft, men det funkar inte. Hon slår mig sen med sin stav och då Planar Escape:ar jag instinktivt. När jag sen är tillbaks är jag vaken. Hilmia säger till mig att jag behöver vara vaken, får inte sova, annars kommer hon sticka mig med en kniv.\nJag försöker ställa mig upp men klarar inte det. Däckar på vägen upp. Tony och Cory börjar försöka dra mig. Och de klarar det en bit, en kort bit och sen däckar de också. Hilmia försöker väcka oss men lyckas inte. Hon tröttnar och vilar under tiden vi sover. När vi sen vaknar så börjar vi gå igen, i halva vår vanliga hastighet.Tony hittar en till bit kött och ser sen en figur en bit bort med två armar och två ben. Den är vänd mot oss. En kort stund senare överraskas vi av en halvt genomskinlig sörja som kommer flygandes emot oss.\nNär Hilmia kollar emot dem igen så ser vi att det är 4 stycken, i full sprint emot oss.Vi ser just nu 4 läskiga varelser. Två av dem verkar skjuta nåt klegg emot oss från deras munnar. Alla har långa klor, och de bakom som spottar har större munnar än de framför. Vi lyckades utan stora problem oskadliggöra varelserna. Vi fortsätter bara gå efter fighten.Vi stannar efter en stund. Funderar lite på om vi ska elda. Tony är VÄLDIGT intresserad av att elda då han fryser. Men det önskar inte Cory och Hilmia, delvis så vi inte drar till oss mer läskiga varelser. Vi bestämmer oss för att inte elda och Tony blir deppig och sätter sig o deppar istället för att sova, men han somnar också efter en stund.Under natten så hör Hilmia ljudet av jetskis med trollkarlar på. Tvåtaktare. De hoppas och flippar över sanddynorna.Vi sover inte alls länge innan vi vaknar långt innan solen går upp. Vi går och går och träffar ibland på såna varelser vi nyligen slagits mot. Allt känns obehagligt. Solen är för stark, och varm, natten är för kall. Inget är bra. Alla mår skitdåligt.Hilmia ser en stor staty en bit bort. Hon ser att det är nån form av tiger som typ dansar jämte statyn.\nHilmia pratar lite med Holger. Han mår ok säger han, men det är såååå varmt och han vill gärna ha ett sånt där bär som Hilmia trollat fram förr. Vi alla ser figuren och statyn. När vi kommer närmare ser upptäcker vi att figuren, tigern, har tummarna på fel sida av handen. Tony vill ha uppmärksamhet och vrålar till den, men får ingen respons.Vi ser en öppen ask med en rykande pipa i, på ett bord jämte tigern.\nVi kommer ganska nära den innan den prompt stannar upp med det den håller på med innan den ganska snabbt vänder sig om mot oss och Tony börjar prata. Han pratar Rakash.De pratar lite och efter en stund sveper han med handen och ett rosa moln kommer fram, och ur molnet kommer en röd sidensoffa. Han gör samma sak igen och ett rosa moln bakom honom förvandlas till en fåtölj. Vi sätter oss.Cory ber Tony kollar om han kan fixa vår curse, vilket han inte kan.På Rakash:\nTony frågar om han kan hjälpa oss på nåt sätt. Och det säger han att han kan. Men tillbaks, säger funderar han vad VI kan göra för HONOM.\nLite diskussion sker och tigern häller upp lite vin i ett glas och börjar dricka. Han frågar Tony: ”Är du inte törstig? Varsågod, ta lite”\nTony kämpar hårt med att inte ta något, vi andra som inte tycker om vin på samma sätt känner ett drag men inte så mycket som Tony. Tony frågar vad det är för bär. Han svarar ”Rafnaff”.<br>\nTony säger att han inte kan ta vinet. Vi behöver komma till de <a data-href=\"Mörka Magikerna\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mörka Magikerna</a>. Tigern svarar då att ”ahh. Ja, ni vill få deras uppmärksamhet. Sånt strunt”\n”I suppose real power doesn’t show itself in appearances”Han tar en djup andning i pipan och sen pratar han Common med oss. ”Ni hade inte behövt svälta er själva ifrån första början, de hade redan uppmärksammat er sen tidigare.””Jag kan ta er till dem men först ge er mat, vatten och sovplats. Men innan det behöver jag hjälp med en liten tvist. Ni behöver bara följa med mig som sällskap till en vän.” ”När vi anländer, så vill jag be något av er, för er egen skull. Prata inte med någon, var inte otrevlig mot någon. Det är allt. Det finns regler att följa.\nOch ni må ha imponerat på några av det finare gardet, men ni är inte odödliga”Ärendet vi ska följa med och hjälpa han med är av ”den där” typen, fight kan vara del av det. Jag nämner Irago av en händelse och han rycker till och börjar prata om honom.Angående Irago. Han är ”Den ensamma”. Det finns bara han, det brukade finnas 7. Det finns anledning till varför bara han är överlevande. När hans kumpaner gick bort så delade de sina krafter till de andra som var kvar. Nu när bara han är kvar, så har han kraften för alla 7. Han är ett förebud för Lamals vilja. En Härold.\nHan sätter alltid ett märke på alla dem som han ska ta livet av, ”bakom ryggen” på dem. Han ville kolla så inte vi hade markeringen, vilket vi inte hade.Han knäpper med fingrarna och statyn rör sig snabbare än vad vi hinner reagera på och ett ljus fyller vår syn och vi ser inget annat. När det vita är borta sitter vi i ett väldigt fint matrum med mängder av mat. Han ber oss hugga in och sen går han, ”Vi ses om några timmar.” När han stängt dörren hör vi stora tunga steg gå mot det svart/vit-rutiga golvet.\nEn stor staty kommer till oss och ställer fram mängder av olika maträtter. Jag frågar om vi faktiskt borde äta. Cory svarar mitt i efterrätten att ”jag har redan ätit”. Tony hade också börjat äta redan. Blev lite fundersam på om detta kommer tvinga oss till fler tjänster. Men vi äter ändå, alla utom Hilmia.Tony tyckte om vinet och vi lassar ner lite i min väska. Tigern kommer tillbaks och Tony frågar om det är OK, vilket det är. Han säger till och med att Tony kan ta allt som är kvar på bordet.<br><a data-href=\"Aksayakumara\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/aksayakumara.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Aksayakumara</a> introducerar han sig som.

Vi tar oss till nåt hus där vi kan sova ut ordentligt innan vi söker oss runt i staden.\n<br>Vi går och svälter i öknen. Vi träffar ett par zombie-monster typ som vi har ihjäl. Vi fortsätter svälta och sen efter ett tag kommer vi fram till en stor staty och jämte står en tiger med händerna på fel arm(handflatan utåt och tummarna nedåt). Vi pratar med honom och när han börjar lita på oss så tar han med oss till sitt hem typ, där vi får äta hur mycke mat vi vill, om vi gör en tjänst för honom efter vi ätit. Vi går med på det och äter så mycket vi bara kan. Han visar oss sedan ut ur byggnaden och då ser vi att vi är högt uppe i en flygande stad ovanför molning. <a data-href=\"Maraja\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/04_places/shrivell's-reach/maraja.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Maraja</a>\nAllt känns som det kan vara insidan av ett palats. Men det är så det ser ut utomhus. Fontäner, växter, flödande vatten, broar, träd. Det ser ut som nån himmelsk stad. Det finns mängder av luftskepp som verkar frakta prylar. Vi ser svävande fält där det odlas sädeslag och annat.\nDet finns många skyltar med text på ett språk vi inte förstår (Tony kanske gör det).<br>Vi står högst upp på nån trappa på en enskild ö vid sidan av staden. <a data-href=\"Aksayakumara\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/aksayakumara.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Aksayakumara</a> har börjat gå ned för trappan och vi hänger efter. Vi går in mot staden och ser flertalet stånd och folk lite överallt som går omkring. <br>Jag går fram och frågar <a data-href=\"Aksayakumara\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/aksayakumara.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Aksayakumara</a> om han har något smeknamn, som är lite kortare och lättare att komma ihåg än hela hans långa namn. Jag får en känsla av att han blir irriterad och besviken. Sen flinar han lite och säger att ”självklart, vad skulle DU vilja kalla mig?”. Jag säger att jag vill veta vad han brukar bli kallad, det är upp till honom och inte mig. Han säger att jag kan kalla honom för <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Aksayakumara\" data-href=\"Aksayakumara\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/aksayakumara.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Saya</a>. Hilmia frågar om han säljer något på marknaden här. Han säger att han säljer mycket grejer. Tony vill veta vad för valuta de använder, då han tidigare nämnt att de inte är intresserade av guld. Han tar upp ett mynt, som Hilmia upptäcker luktar Svavel. Myntet är i någon mörk metall som är VÄLDIGT fint graverad. Mynten kallas för Själmynt (Soul Coin). Varje mynt är en själ.\nDe är värda väldigt mycket. Och framförallt används de till tjänster. Han berättar kort om ett annat mynt han tar upp och visar.\n”Detta var en man som andra gången han slängde sig framför de mörka magikerna fick sin önskan, eller tjänst, uppfylld. Hans familjs fält kommer i flera decennier bära rik skörd.”Lizardfolk, människor, alver och till och från ser man sån tigermänniska som han är. Han leder oss upp på ett skepp som vi sätter oss på. Vi flyger bort och han pekar på en ö en bit bort. ”Dit ska vi”<br>\nHan berättar att dessa palats tillhör köpmän, såna som han. Utöver det säger han att vi säkert har gissat vid detta laget, att vi ska till en köpmanna-rival. Att det är dit vi ska och hjälpa <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Aksayakumara\" data-href=\"Aksayakumara\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/aksayakumara.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Saya</a> med en tjänst.<br>”<a data-href=\"Mahmoud’s Mystic Arcanum\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/04_places/shrivell's-reach/mahmoud’s-mystic-arcanum.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mahmoud’s Mystic Arcanum</a>” står det på en skylt vid ett hus på ön vi är på väg till. Vi ser nån tjomme på ett tak som ropar ut något till en hel del folk framför byggnaden. <br>Cory frågar vad som händer om man skulle bryta mot regler, till exempel stjäla Soul Coins. <a data-href=\"Aksayakumara\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/aksayakumara.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Aksayakumara</a> svarar att ”stjäl man ett mynt, kommer en Colossus…” och så pekar han på en metalljätte en bra bit bort, ”att ta ditt liv, utan att ens behöva se dig.

Då får väl du ta tillbaks det bara.”<br>Ärendet vi ska på nu är lite åt den genren berättar <a data-href=\"Aksayakumara\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/aksayakumara.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Aksayakumara</a>.

Han skapar Golems. Från grunden, han ’programmerar’ dem och ingen annan än han just nu vet hur man kan skapa en golem från noll. Därför kan <a data-href=\"Aksayakumara\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/aksayakumara.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Aksayakumara</a> inte bara ta med sina Golems, utan behöver något mer ”köttigt”. <a data-href=\"Al-Riyada\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/al-riyada.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Al-Riyada</a> kan vända på Golems och få dem på sin sida berättar han.

Det går inte förstöra honom.Väl framme finns det mycket folk som vrålar på varandra hållandes i prylar. Männen har turbaner och många har långt skägg, damerna har många smycken och ringar på armarna. <br>Vi möts av golems som står vid sidan av den större dörren in till vart vi ska. De är beväpnade. Bara något större än oss, kanske dryga 2 meter långa. <a data-href=\"Aksayakumara\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/aksayakumara.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Aksayakumara</a> trycker upp dörrarna och han leder oss djupt in i palatset.

Knackar på igen och då öppnas dörrarna utåt mot oss. Där inne ser vi en stor stor forge. Det finns en stor pool med lava, en stor forge i mitten och mängder av andra verktyg och grejer. Ståendes där, ser vi <a data-href=\"Al-Riyada\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/al-riyada.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Al-Riyada</a>, en liknande tigermänniska som <a data-href=\"Aksayakumara\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/aksayakumara.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Aksayakumara</a>.<br>De börjar prata. <a data-href=\"Aksayakumara\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/aksayakumara.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Aksayakumara</a> försöker poängtera att <a data-href=\"Al-Riyada\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/al-riyada.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Al-Riyada</a> vet varför han är här, och magiskt kommer det fram något att sitta på. <br>\n”Jag vet varför du är här. Men det finns inget du kan ge mig som är tillräckligt.” - <a data-href=\"Al-Riyada\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/al-riyada.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Al-Riyada</a>\n<br>\n”Mina vänner jag tog med mig här, de är trötta, slitna.

Kör på bara. Jag vill ändå ha reda på vilka felaktigheter eller problem den har så jag kan fixa dem.” - <a data-href=\"Al-Riyada\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/al-riyada.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Al-Riyada</a>\n<br><a data-href=\"Aksayakumara\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/aksayakumara.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Aksayakumara</a> ber oss, ”snälla, ni kan väl ställa er på dansgolvet. Ställ er upp.”\nVi ställer oss upp och börjar röra oss. Då börjar en golem komma ner mot oss. Den är i sten, och ser ut som en VÄLDIGT muskulös man. Det finns någon form av mist som flyter sakta genom bröstkorgen på den, pulserande. Mellan fingrarna ser vi också den röra sig sakta. Jag slänger Detect Magic. Det allra mesta jag känner av är Transmutation magic. Även golemen utsöndrar mängder av sån magi. Evocation magi från stolarna och lamporna i taket. Även flera andra skolor känner jag av. Det enda jag inte känner av Necromancy.\nJag frågar Bagge, mentalt, ”Vet du om jag kan göra något åt transmutations magin som golemen innehar?”. Han svarar, ”njaaee inte direkt. Om man hade kunnat väldigt stark magi, kanske”. Jag slänger Raulothim’s Psychic Lance. Men INGEN effekt alls.\nVi försöker en del till men inget fungerar. När jag skjuter mot den så öppnas sprickorna i hans kropp för att släppa igenom vapnet eller skottet eller magin. Sen stängs den igen. Den rör sig väldigt rytmiskt. Allt den gör är i takt med sin andning. Jag kommer på att vi kanske kan skjuta/slå inuti den. Jag säger högt till de andra, ”Hörni, kan ni slå mot honom först så skjuter jag sen när han öppnar sig”.\nTony och Cory slår emot den och den öppnar sig. Jag skjuter en Eldritch Blast in mot insidan av kroppen och vi alla hör ett högt sprickande ljud. (Nat 20 på sista blasten).\nEfter det rollar Cory OCH Tony varsin Nat 20 också på sina attacker och vi hör fler sprickande ljud. Vi ser att det kommer ut splittror av en orange kristall ur mitten av bröstkorgen när Cory och Tony sliter ut det med sina vapen. Cory lyckas dessutom med sin andra attack och sliter bort ena benet. <br><a data-href=\"Al-Riyada\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/al-riyada.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Al-Riyada</a> sitter med sin pipa och nickar mest förstående. Han inspekterar mest hur och vad vi gör.Vi fortsätter på detta sättet tills den dör. Den exploderar i en stor pust av sån mist som var runt den. På marken finns det kvar en ganska stor ädelsten som har färgen av bärnsten, amber. Men utöver det ser vi tre röda glimmande fjädrar. De ser verkligen overkliga ut.<br>Vi hör att en av katterna ställer sig upp och börjar applådera, det är <a data-href=\"Al-Riyada\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/al-riyada.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Al-Riyada</a>, skaparen av golemen.\n”Ni kommer passa bra in här. Inte många kan få respekt snabbt, men ni kommer nog lösa det galant här.””Vänligen, återvänd aldrig.” säger han. Han tar sedan upp huvudet av golemen och kollar på den, ristar lite på den och sen slänger han ner huvudet i lavan.Tony plockar upp en av fjädrarna som ligger på backen. Han blir helt konstig dock. Hans ögonlock börjar spasma och öppna o stänga sig, han skakar lite i kroppen och han är borta.<br>\n<a data-href=\"Aksayakumara\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/aksayakumara.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Aksayakumara</a> börjar gå fram till oss. Han lägger en hand på Tony och hjälper honom ut ur transen och säger till Tony; ”Snälla, gör inte om det.”\nTony svarar: ”Nej aldrig”.<br>\nSen tar <a data-href=\"Aksayakumara\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/aksayakumara.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Aksayakumara</a> upp fjädrarna och lägger dem i sin bröstficka. <br>Jag går fram till den orangea stenen, som nu är ganska splittrad. Använder Identify på det som är kvar. Det är en före detta Infusad Koda (Sap) som tillhör Silver ek. I dess nuvarande form kan jag säga att det är värdelöst. Men jag får en idé utav det. Förstenad koda kanske är användbart. Den krystalliserade formen kanske jag kan återanvända, alltså en kärna. <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Items.canvas\" data-href=\"Items.canvas\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/01_pcs/singwin-mistwalker-folder/while-playing/items.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Dragonscale Whetstone</a> kanske kan användas på samma sätt, som en kärna för något.\nAlltså spara den i sin nuvarande form och använda den på så sätt. Istället för att försöka infusa den i nåt annat objekt.Vi går igenom alla rum igen tills vi kommer ut. Vi går vidare en bit innan vi stannar och tackar varandra lite kort. Han är tacksam för tjänsten vi gjort för honom och han tycker vi kan börja gå mot mitten av stan för att komma vidare med det kring vår curse. Han säger också att allt som ligger öppet och finns på stan är fritt att ta av. Men det gäller tvåvägs, ha koll på hur ni har era prylar.<br>\nHan säger att för att komma till huvud-ön så är det bara att hoppa på en båt, de går regelbundet. Och han nämner också att det om vi ska gå nånstans först, rekommenderar han <a data-href=\"Mahmoud’s Mystic Arcanum\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/04_places/shrivell's-reach/mahmoud’s-mystic-arcanum.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mahmoud’s Mystic Arcanum</a>.<br>Vi är väldigt sugna på att ta en tupplur innan vi gör något mer, så vi kanske kan bli av med något steg <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Session 37 - 2023-11-26 > Exhaustion 1\" data-href=\"Session 37 - 2023-11-26#Exhaustion 1\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-37-2023-11-26.html#Exhaustion 1\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Exhaustion</a> till. Vi hoppar på första bästa båt tillbaks till stora ön och vi letar efter nånstans att sova. Tillbaks på huvud-ön ser vi mängder av folk. Men inte fler raser än tidigare. Vi känner lite hunger och ser något stånd där en golem gör lite bröd över en eld. Någon annan går fram och plockar med sig bröd och går där ifrån. Vi tänker då att de borde vara ok så vi tar också lite bröd var och drar vidare. Vi går förbi någon byggnad där vi ser relativt lättklädda män och kvinnor som dansar sensuellt. Vi ser folk sova där inne så vi går in och kollar runt lite och letar efter nånstans att sova. Tony går iväg o letar och kommer tillbaks kort efter och berättar att det verkar vara på samma sätt som med maten.\nTony tar ett rum själv, Hilmia tycker inte om stället riktigt så hon stannar utanför och säger vi ska möta henne imorgon bitti. Jag o Cory drar upp en våning och hittar där ett rum med en dubbelsäng. Vi slaggar till morgonen. Vi tar två longrests, 16h sovande. Går upp vid brunch-tid dagen efter.Hilmia spenderar en del av tiden till o checka stan. Kvällen och natten går.

Vi löser det snabbt och smidigt, om än på ett ganska aggressivt och brute-forced sätt. Det var tre fjädrar som han ville åt. (Under fighten fick vi 3 Nat20s I RAD. Och utöver det 1 crit till). <a data-href=\"Aksayakumara\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/aksayakumara.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Aksayakumara</a> leder oss ut, tackar för tjänsten och önskar oss lycka på vårt sökande. Vi tar oss till nåt hus där vi kan sova ut ordentligt innan vi söker oss runt i staden.\nJag vaknar tidigare än tänkt och känner att jag sovit dåligt trots att det vart länge.\nPå vägen hit till stället vi sover, såg jag något i ögonvrån som såg intressant ut. Jag går ut och ser flertalet olika stånd som folk står vid. Jag ser inte någon av mina kumpaner, inte ens Hilmia, som skulle vänta på oss utanför.Jag börjar gå mot det där intressant, åt det hållet jag tror den var åt. Går förbi en stor fin trädgård med mycket växter, blommor och plantor. Ser en person som har lite tråkigare kläder på sig än alla andra, han verkar arbeta i trädgården. Han luktar, tar i och känner på växterna.<br>Kommer tillslut fram till observatoriet, <a data-href=\"Mahmoud’s Mystic Arcanum\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/04_places/shrivell's-reach/mahmoud’s-mystic-arcanum.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mahmoud’s Mystic Arcanum</a>. Finns några som går omkring där, både in och ut. Väl inne är det en enorm sal, som ett stort kors. Rakt fram är det en enorm… konstruktion? av något slag. Den är i metall, trappor runtomkring och det finns en del uppbyggnader i trä också. Det är den stora stora kikaren. Nedanför den finns det en plats att sitta som verkar vara precis vid ett kikglas så man kan titta igenom kikaren.Finns mängder av skåp och glasbyråer som är fyllda med svärd, bitar från rustningar och mycket annat. Ser en man som sticker ut lite ur mängden. Han har en vit stor robe, och ganska stort vitt skägg. Ett bälte med verktyg, Artificer’s Tools. Han kollar på någon klump av material med hjälp av en monokel som har en monokel som har en monokel, flera på varandra. Skåpen verkar vara uppdelat i olika typer av objekt. Rustningar, svärd, sköldar, rods, hattar.\nJag blir lite besviken av hantverket. De måste snarare vara uppvisade för sina magiska properties snarare än hur de ser ut.\nHittar en röd huva med tillhörande kappa.Bagge säger ”Tycker du inte att lite mycket folk kollar på dig”.<br>\n”Jag vill varna om en grej. Jag har fått… Det är ovanligt, men ibland får jag ett ärende som stryks. Och under natten du sov så fick jag tre stycken, som alla tre har strykts. Alla tre från <a data-href=\"Maraja\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/04_places/shrivell's-reach/maraja.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Maraja</a>.”\n”Det som kan hända.. Antingen en fiende kan göra ett bud till oss och Stora G nekar det. Eller så kan det vara att Stora G spår något. Vi brukar inte lägga oss i politik och annat, men det kan ske när det är något väldigt stort, som gäller planen bortom detta. Bara så du vet.” Jag frågar ifall han med monoklarna har kollat mot oss, och Bagge säger att han kollar just nu. Jag vinkar men han bara tittar undan då.Går till han med monoklarna. Hälsar, men han tittar bara bort. Kollar på stenen han håller, och jag tror det är Brimstone, infernal järn av något slag.Jag frågar om järnet och han svarar med att gå iväg och ställa undan järnet, komma tillbaks, sätter på sig en läderhjälm och sen börjar han prata med mig på nåt annat språk, men jag förstår ändå.<br>Vi pratar lite kort innan han tycker att vi bör prata ensamma, så han tar med mig en bit bort. Vi pratar lite, det är han som är Mahmoud, och därmed ägaren av <a data-href=\"Mahmoud’s Mystic Arcanum\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/04_places/shrivell's-reach/mahmoud’s-mystic-arcanum.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mahmoud’s Mystic Arcanum</a> som vi befinner oss på.\nHan erbjuder mig, mot ett soul coin, att jag kan få använda hans smedja och nån han kände till att smida något. Han sa att han tror inte att jag borde köpa något, det är mer värt för mig att smida själv.\nUtöver det berättar han att jag borde gömma min väska. Det har tidigare varit någon som jag, med väska. Han dog efter ett kort tag av okänd orsak. Väl klar går jag ut och precis utanför huset så stöter någon in i mig och tar Bagge från min axel och springer iväg.\nBrun huva, brun mantel.\nPersonen är barfota, med tassar. Gula med svarta ringar. Det är en manlig figur. En Tabaxi är det.\nJag Misty Steppar fram mot den, slänger Hold Person och lyckas ta tillbaks väskan. Under tiden jag tar tillbaks den ser jag en likadan Tabaxi på ett hustak en kort bit bort. Han håller en kniv i handen. Men när jag kollar på han så drar han ner huvan ovanför ansiktet och sticker iväg.\nNär jag fått tag i väskan springer jag iväg mot härbärget vi sov på.Springer upp och hämtar Cory och sen möter vi Hilmia och Tony i entrén.\nVi pratar massa om vad de hade gjort under morgonen/natten. De hade fixat 2 soul coins till sig och skrivit in sig nånstans.\nTony ger mig och Cory var sin potion som ska vara till oss så vi ska kunna förstå Rakash. Jag dricker min potion, (rollar 2 på const save). Känner mig lite konstig och snurrig en minut, håller på att trilla i backen. Smakar som rosvatten. Ett tag framåt har jag tappat 2 Charisma. Jag förstår inte Rakash efter detta.\nPotionen som Tony gav till Cory ville inte han dricka. Till slut tar jag den och identifyar, och det var en Potion of Longevity.Vi pratar vidare och efter en stund bestämmer vi oss för att gå till alkemisten och ta riktiga Rakash-potions. I samband med det sveper jag Potion of Longevity och min ålder sänks med 7 år.Cory och Tony diskuterar en del om förtroende och att lita på folk.\nEfter det går vi till alkemisten och dricker var sin potion så vi förstår språket.<br>Går sedan till observatoriet, <a data-href=\"Mahmoud’s Mystic Arcanum\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/04_places/shrivell's-reach/mahmoud’s-mystic-arcanum.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mahmoud’s Mystic Arcanum</a>. Vi träffar Mahmoud och går med honom till lite mer privat område. Tony sa att vi vill prata om lite dilemma om uppdraget de fick. Tony berättar att de pratade med personen, Tony slappade honom som Mahmoud sa, sen slog han med en hammare som Mahmoud sa m.m. Men han accepterade inte det så de pratade lite men kom inte fram till någon deal. Så Tony och Hilmia ville prata lite med Mahmoud igen om detta, vilket vi då gör nu.Det blev en del diskussion och vi försöker hitta en lösning.\nJag berättar lite kort att jag blev rånad precis efter jag lämnade tidigare. Nämnde att det var en Tabaxi, varpå Mahmoud säger att han bara känner till 3 stycken Tabaxi i staden, varav en av dem ska börja arbeta hos honom snart. Har inte helt kommit fram till något, men förslag var att försöka få hit munken till Mahmoud så de får prata, och kanske om det löser problemen, så får vi rabatten som Hilmia behöver.Vi tar fram lite prylar att sälja. Och till slut gav vi Gloves of Missile Snaring, 2 handfuls av Pixie Dust, Everice Box och Displacer Beast Hide. Det var han villig att ge 2 Soul coins för, som då jag och Cory får varsitt.Vi börjar gå efter detta för att skriva in mig och Cory i statsregistret. Vi går upp för de stora trapporna som leder upp till nästa nivå, men vi stoppas av de två stora golemarna, och direkt kommer en liten tant ut ur en dörr vid sidan av som bjuder in oss för att bli uppskrivna.<br>\nJag går fram först och hon ber om fullständigt namn, ålder, vilket plan man kommer ifrån och om man är en Celestial. Väl klart la hon pappret i ett kuvert och gav till en postpojke utanför. Han tog emot våra soul coins och välkomnade oss till <a data-href=\"Maraja\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/04_places/shrivell's-reach/maraja.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Maraja</a>. Sen sprang han iväg väldigt flambojant. Diskuterar lite vad vi ska göra, men vi tänker vi ska prata med munken lite. Det kommer upp att vi kanske får avliva honom, och då talar Cory upp och säger att vi absolut INTE kan bara döda någon. Tony går emot och de sker lite diskussion och det utbryter nästan en duell till döden på trapporna mellan de båda.Vi går sen ner igen mot den där munken o ska se om vi kan övertala honom att gå o prata med Mahmoud. Vi går till en brygga och åker med en båt till en annan ö. Väl där går vi förbi flera torg och ser många folk som verkar ha nån form av teater på torgen.\nVi kommer till en oktagonformad byggnad utan dörr på sidorna. Det finns bara en lucka på taket och jag o Tony klättrar upp, medan Cory tar Hilmia på ryggen och hoppar upp. Sen klättrar vi ner i luckan. Det är becksvart. Inte ett enda ljus. Tony leder oss framåt till nästa rum som han påstod var ljust. Vi kommer dit och då börjar vi höra en röst som Tony pratar med. Han ber oss komma in och visa oss. <br>Ljusgrå/blå hy. Ganska kort vitt hår. Spetsiga öron. Tunn men muskulös kropp. <a data-href=\"Leeziou\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Leeziou</a> heter han. Tony berättar om vad Mahmoud sa. Och vi pratar lite.<br>\nTill slut försöker Hilmia övertala honom med att bara tala sanning och vad han än faktiskt vill. Berätta att det är för hans folk osv. Och att det betyder mycket för honom och hans folk. Han går med på att detta är hans bästa chans men för att han ska göra detta, vill han att vi ska vara där och försvara honom om det vänder emot honom. Vi tror ju inte att Mahmoud ska göra något då det var det han sa till oss, så vi tappar ju inget på det, säger <a data-href=\"Leeziou\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Leeziou</a>. Han ropar något namn, och då ser vi att det står en dvärg utanför dörren till rummet vi befinner oss i, siktandes en crossbow emot oss. När han hör sitt namn så hängar han den på ryggen och hälsar på oss.<br>Vi går ut och följer med <a data-href=\"Leeziou\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Leeziou</a> och hans dvärg när han plockar upp sina Soul Coins på vägen och vi kommer senare fram till <a data-href=\"Mahmoud’s Mystic Arcanum\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/04_places/shrivell's-reach/mahmoud’s-mystic-arcanum.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mahmoud’s Mystic Arcanum</a>, där <a data-href=\"Leeziou\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Leeziou</a> stannar. Han är orolig, förståeligt. Hilmia går in och säger till <a data-href=\"Mahmoud\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mahmoud</a> att han är här, sen kommer hon ut och vi börjar gå in tätt bakom <a data-href=\"Leeziou\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Leeziou</a>.<br>\n<a data-href=\"Mahmoud\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mahmoud</a> står hängandes på sin marmorbänk och de börjar prata. <a data-href=\"Leeziou\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Leeziou</a> är tydligt besvärad och kämpar hårt för att hålla stubinen i schack. De går strax iväg för att prata privat ett tag. Under tiden står vi 4 och dvärgen kvar. Vi kollar på lite olika prylar som finns här. <br><a data-href=\"Leeziou\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Leeziou</a> kommer ut igen och berättar att det har gått vägen. De har kommit överens. Inte helt som <a data-href=\"Leeziou\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Leeziou</a> ville, då ett krav från <a data-href=\"Mahmoud\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mahmoud</a> var att amuletten ska för alltid bäras av <a data-href=\"Leeziou\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Leeziou</a>. Men det accepterade han för han får åtminstone amuletten. Han tackar oss och ger oss en påse med 32 Platinum, som var allt han hade kvar.\nStrax efter lämnar de båda. <br><a data-href=\"Mahmoud\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mahmoud</a> pratar med oss och är också nöjd, så Hilmia får rabatten på tygstycket hon var sugen på. Han berättar också att han har lite simpelt arbete som inte hans golems kan göra. Det är att hämta syra från en mask i öknen. Det verkar vara en Purple Worm. Magsyran är det han vill ha. Vi kommer i så fall få med oss en vial som kan hålla väldigt stora mängder av vilken vätska som helst.<br>\nVi ska fundera på det lite säger vi till <a data-href=\"Mahmoud\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mahmoud</a>, så vi går upp så länge och ska prata med nån Djinni o se vad det skulle kosta o ta bort vår curse från resterande 3.Vi går upp till en våning högre i stan. Men vi har problem att hitta skyltar eller annat som pekar mot djinnis. Vi hör någon musik som vi följer och kommer till nån taverna. Lite stökigt. Väl inne ser vi någon vi alla känner igen.\nLila stor hatt, lila kläder, långt vitt skägg.<br>\nDet är <a data-href=\"The Wizard\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The Wizard</a>. Han vi träffade i en liten stuga på sydöstra delen av Divided wilds. Han argumenterar starkt med tre andra figurer som är klädda i rött, grönt och blått.<br>Tony ropar till honom och <a data-href=\"The Wizard\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The Wizard</a> bjuder oss till bords för att hälsa hans andra vänner. Gröna, med betar sticker upp ur munnen på dem. Ser ut som orc-trillingar. <br>Han berättar att han har hittat att det finns en till simulakrum av hans bror, här på <a data-href=\"Maraja\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/04_places/shrivell's-reach/maraja.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Maraja</a>.\n”Det verkar som att hans simulakrum har vart väldigt bra att undvika mig. Men jag har utvecklat ett bra sätt att spåra honom på. Har pratat med de mörka magikerna men de tyckte inte syftet jag har var tillräckligt.”Han tror denna är betydligt mycket mer komplex. Den har säkert skapat sig vänner och liknande. Han vill ha lite hjälp med detta.Sen berättar han om ett annat problem som vi alls inte kan hjälpa han med. Han vill ha en kvinna i sin säng ikväll. Tony berättar om några damer han sett tidigare.<br>Vi börjar dra iväg och vi frågar lite om Djinnis till <a data-href=\"The Wizard\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The Wizard</a>. Han erbjuder sig att leda vägen till en han känner. Vi hoppas på en speciellt båt som körs av en elemental. <br>Vi kommer fram och ser en man med blå hy sitta på en svävande matta. <a data-href=\"Sami\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Sami</a> kallar <a data-href=\"The Wizard\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The Wizard</a> han på mattan.<br>\nVi pratar lite med <a data-href=\"Sami\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Sami</a> om att vi vill bli av med vår curse. Han berättar att vi har 6 nätter kvar innan cursen tar våra själar helt. Vi berättar om cursen och lite om vad vi vet om den. Lite om Valetta, Dendallen, soul jaren, öknen osv.\nHan berättar att han kan hjälpa oss kapa cursen för 5 Soul Coins per person.”Ni har stanken av en Rakshasa över er. De kommer skapa mer problem än någonting annat framöver.”<br>Vi röker lite av nån go pipa som&nbsp;<a data-href=\"Sami\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Sami</a> ger oss, som ger oss Fly.<br>\nVi flyger tillbaks mot huvud-ö och ser där <a data-href=\"Aksayakumara\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/aksayakumara.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Aksayakumara</a> stå, leendes väntades på oss.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#session"],"headers":[{"heading":"Current agenda","level":1,"id":"Current_agenda_0"},{"heading":"Goals","level":7,"id":"Goals_0"},{"heading":"Session Summary","level":1,"id":"Session_Summary_0"},{"heading":"Recap of last session","level":2,"id":"Recap_of_last_session_0"},{"heading":"Log","level":1,"id":"Log_0"},{"heading":"Jag kör en kort solosession","level":2,"id":"Jag_kör_en_kort_solosession_0"}],"links":["03_npcs/aksayakumara.html","03_npcs/al-riyada.html","03_npcs/al-riyada.html","03_npcs/aksayakumara.html","03_npcs/al-riyada.html","03_npcs/aksayakumara.html","04_places/shrivell's-reach/mahmoud’s-mystic-arcanum.html","04_places/shrivell's-reach/maraja.html","04_places/shrivell's-reach/mahmoud’s-mystic-arcanum.html","04_places/shrivell's-reach/mahmoud’s-mystic-arcanum.html","04_places/shrivell's-reach/maraja.html",".html",".html",".html","04_places/shrivell's-reach/mahmoud’s-mystic-arcanum.html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html","04_places/shrivell's-reach/maraja.html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html","03_npcs/aksayakumara.html"],"author":"Rasmus","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-39-2023-12-18.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":["05_quests/current-goals-singwin-mistforger.md","02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-38-2023-12-03.html"],"createdTime":1730964968693,"modifiedTime":1731699500925,"sourceSize":13116,"sourcePath":"02_Journal/Thalbrine - Big campaign/Session 39 - 2023-12-18.md","exportPath":"02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-39-2023-12-18.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":218,"backlinks":["02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-40-2023-12-26.html"],"type":"markdown"},"02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-40-2023-12-26.html":{"title":"Session 40 - 2023-12-26","icon":"","description":"Session number: 58\nBörjade spela omkring: 09:53\nHitta ett sätt att få hem Holger\nFixa ett material med ursprung från the Astral Plane\nHälsa på Semil Wildmagic i Bastion Shore\nKomma på ett namn på byn där Cecil och Arvid finns Bruh\nVi landar med båten och möter <a data-href=\"Aksayakumara\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/aksayakumara.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Aksayakumara</a>.

Hon märker att det sitter en och tittar mot oss, bakom nocken på ett tak.Vi tänker vi ska gå till Mörka Magikerna för o kolla om de kan fixa cursen och isf vad det kan kosta. Diskuterar lite kring det. Vi beslutar att gå mot dem.Vi går vägen vi tror leder dit. Efter ett tag kommer vi fram nånstans med mörka stenar med inristningar på. Vi lyckas inte tyda det, och känner inte heller igen stenen eller typen av inristning.Vi kommer fram nånstans som vi känner kan vara rätt. Finns en trappa upp och vi ser en metallbur ovanför trapporna. Ganska stor, typ 4 meter hög. Buren har öppna svängdörrar. Slänger Detect Magic och känner att buren har någon Enchantment magi på sig. Vi har under tiden dit blivit förföljda av den där figuren som Hilmia såg. Den smyger sig upp, knäpptyst, för trappan emot oss. Vi tittar mot den men den fortsätter gå. Hilmia går fram ett par steg emot den. Den fortsätter gå, sen ganska nära Hilmia, börjar den sträcka sin arm mot något den har på ryggen. Den plockar fram ett pergament som den ger till Hilmia, sen smyger den sakta iväg med blicken emot oss.<br>Det är ett brev från <a data-href=\"Al-Riyada\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/al-riyada.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Al-Riyada</a>. Han var imponerad över vårt arbete sist vi sågs, och han önskar få vår hjälp igen. Han har skickat en båt som kommer vänta på oss ett dygn, men han önskar att vi kommer snarast möjligt oavsett. Givetvis får de som medverkar en belöning.Vi går in i buren igen och Tony vrider på hjulet som är i mitten. Det gnisslar högt och sen börjar buren flyta sakta uppåt. Efter en stund ser vi en stoooor golem med armarna över bröstet. När vi når en viss höjd sträcker den ut en arm och tar tag i buren. När den flyttar buren ser vi många olika portar och golemen ställer oss vid den nedersta av portar.Portarna är otroligt stora, säkert 8 meter höga. Porten öppnas liite grann för oss när vi har satts ner. Vi ser igenom porten att det är en enorm sal och ser en del folk som står och pratar i mindre grupper.\nDet finns något form av bås som verkar vara en mottagningsdisk/reception. Vi börjar gå dit.På vägen ser vi att många av alla folken som är där är utsvultna och tunna, smala.\nDen andra typen av folk som är här är några med helt svarta kläder, svart huva. De har även helt svarttäckta ögon.\nNär vi kommer in vinkar personen i receptionen till oss.Vi kommer fram och vi säger hej. Hon svarar, ”ahh, Common.” Det är en ganska blek dam.\n”I vilket ärende är ni här?”\n”Vi vill ha hjälp av The Dark Mages” säger Tony.\nHon svarar, igen, ”Och i vilket ärende är ni här?”\n”Vi har en curse, eller 3 olika curses. En curse som 3 personer har. Den suger ut våra själar till en lich”\n”Ah. Okej.” Hon skriver ner lite saker på ett papper och ger sedan till oss.\n”Ge det till dörrvakten, den kommer vara er ledsagare. När ni kommer in, visa stor tacksamhet oavsett vad ni får för respons, tala inte om ni inte blivit tillfrågade och följ etikett!”Vi tar pappret och går iväg. Vi blir ledda genom ett par portar till nån annan sal där det är en kö framåt. Det är en tronsal. Det finns 7 stolar, säten i en halvcirkel längst fram i kön. Alla stolar är inte tillsatta, några få är tomma.Vi ser att när någon kommer längst fram i kön, sätter de säg på knä med pannan i backen medan dens ledsagare berättar ärendet de är där för. När personen blir tillfrågad någonting så böjer personen endast upp sitt huvud och svarar på frågan, sen kvickt ner med pannan i marken igen.Vi går framåt i kön lite och möts av en man som tar emot vårt papper. Han läser det och pratar lite med oss.<br>\n”Hur länge har ni varit i <a data-href=\"Maraja\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/04_places/shrivell's-reach/maraja.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Maraja</a>?”\n”jaoo, typ 3 dagar kanske”\n”Ni ser… väldigt friska ut” svarar han\n”Tack!” svarar Tony.\nAlla andra ser ut att svälta ihjäl, det som vi borde ha gjort för att ha kommit hit.”Om allt går väl så kan ni få en markering i stadsregistret. Då kan ni få jobb igenom den”Vi ser flera framför som ber o någonting och det beviljas, och sen kommer deras konferencier fram med ett mynt, sätter det mot huvudet på den knäböjde och efter ett par sekunder faller kroppen ihop och tynar bort.\nSamma sker för den framför. Den ber om att dens son ska få ärva något speciellt. Det beviljas och kroppen faller ihop och tynar bort.Vi kommer fram och försöker göra som vi ska (men 3 rolls blev rätt dåliga, 7, nat 1, 8 och sen en nat 20). Cory sätter sig på knä men stöter i sitt spjut i marken och trillar mot mig som också trillar lite. Sen sätter vi oss tillrätta. Vi ser bakom oss att de som står i kö blir helt förstenade, hur kan vi göra så? Vår konferencier spänner upp ögonen på oss.\nMen han läser sedan upp pappret som vår önskan står på. De i stolarna diskuterar. De som sitter är mestadels likadan, förutom damen längst till vänster som ser väldigt gammal ut och har även på sig en väldigt varm och tjock kappa. Hon verkar vara lite annorlunda. Hon verkar typ känna till oss sen tidigare.\nHon ställer lite frågor och vi berättar lite om Valetta som vi tror har cursat oss, om Dendallens rustning, Lamals gravplats, Gull’a. Hon säger sen att de kommer bevilja vårt önskemål, att ta bort våra curses. Men i gengäld ska vi arbeta för dem i 3 år.\nVi får diskutera det, vilket vi gör. Vi kommer fram till att Nej, vi vill inte vara fast här i 3 år.\nVi tackar nej till erbjudandet.De tycker det är tråkigt, men kan förstå det då vi är äventyrare, all tid är viktigt för oss.Damen har ett annat erbjudande, till mig. Hon vill kolla på en ägodel till mig och när hon är klar får jag tillbaks den i samma skick, säger hon. Hon säger att jag får 3 soul coins i gengäld.\nBagge säger direkt att ”NEJNEJENEJNEJNJENNEEJJJENEJENJENEJ! Det får hon INTE. Om hon kollar på väskan så sticker jag.”Jag tackar nej även till detta erbjudande.\nHon tycker det är beklagligt. Men det finns ingen mening att försöka ta den med våld heller, säger hon. Vi tackar för oss och börjar gå iväg. Tony frågar mig varför jag inte accepterar det? Det var ju 3 enkla soul coins fixade. Vi pratar lite med vår konferencier och tackar även honom innan vi går till buren igen. Golemen tar upp oss och bär oss tillbaka.\nUnder resan börjar Bagge prata och frågar Tony vad han undrar. Bagge berättar att om De Mörka Magikerna ville, så kunde de ge mat och liv till hela Shrivell’s Reach utan några problem. Men det vill de inte. De vill fortsätta ha det så här så folk måste komma hit och offra sina liv för dem och bli Soul Coins. Det är samma valuta som de har i The 9 Hells bl.a.<br>Vi landar med buren och sen funderar vi lite vart vi ska gå. Vi tror vi drar till <a data-href=\"Al-Riyada\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/al-riyada.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Al-Riyada</a>, för han hade lite mer bråttom och han kändes lite trevligare. <br>Vi går till båten han hade bokat till oss och åker med den. Vi kommer till ”Forgery”, ”förfalskningen”. Vi går in och en golem går med oss och öppnar dörrarna framför oss. Den leder oss nästan till samma plats som vi var på sist vi var här, men den svänger vänster istället och leder oss en annan väg. Vi kommer till nåt kontor där <a data-href=\"Al-Riyada\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/al-riyada.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Al-Riyada</a> sitter vid ett bord med pipa o nån dryck och annat.Han välkomnar oss och känner på lukten att vi redan vart hos Alhambra (mörka magikerna). Han trollar fram lite stolar som vi sätter oss på.<br>\nHan berättar att han hör hört att vi fått ett uppdrag från <a data-href=\"Aksayakumara\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/aksayakumara.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Aksayakumara</a>.<br>\n”Jag erbjuder er samma som <a data-href=\"Aksayakumara\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/aksayakumara.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Aksayakumara</a> gör, om ni gör motsatsen till vad han säger. Om han ville att ni skulle ha ihjäl monstret, så vill jag att ni släpper det fritt. Ni får samma betalning av mig som ni skulle fått av <a data-href=\"Aksayakumara\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/aksayakumara.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Aksayakumara</a>.”<br>Han erbjuder också mer betalt, en tjänst åt Tony. Om vi gör det han önskar, så kommer <a data-href=\"Al-Riyada\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/al-riyada.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Al-Riyada</a> fixa så Tony kan få en ersättningshand i metall. <br><a data-href=\"Aksayakumara\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/aksayakumara.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Aksayakumara</a> har ett företag typ för att hantera själskrukor. Har det på 3 platser. Han tar folks sista andetag och sätter dem i krukor, och sedan förvandla dem till Soul Coins. <br>Vi diskuterar en bra stund om lite olika saker, bl.a. om detta är en moraliskt ok sak att göra. Vi kommer fram till att de låter rätt bra ändå så vi kommer nog försöka göra detta uppdraget istället. Får försöka göra det i hemlighet så <a data-href=\"Aksayakumara\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/aksayakumara.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Aksayakumara</a> inte förstår att vi gör något annat.<br>Vi drar iväg och funderar lite. Det börjar bli lite kväll så vi tänker nog fixa damer till <a data-href=\"The Wizard\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The Wizard</a> först, sen sova och sen på morgonen fixa med monstret. <br>Vi åker till <a data-href=\"Aksayakumara\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/aksayakumara.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Aksayakumara</a>s ö för o dra till badhuset o hitta ett par goa ladies.\nVi möter upp två damer som Tony verkar känna sen tidigare. Han försöker övertala dem att hänga med The Wizard en kväll, men går inte helbra. Det de gick med på var att ses på morgonen, men BARA om Tony är med också. Och han accepterade det. Så de ska ses på morgonen imorgon o sen ska Tony ta med dem till The Wizard.Vi går mot härbärget och plockar ett par Tongues-potions på vägen. Jag stannar och knackar på och sen går in i huset som som gör potions. En liten dam är där och jag frågar om hon kan fixa potions för att se osynliga saker. Hon säger att hon kan det, men behöver betalning, antingen i en mer sällsynt ingrediens eller 1 soul coin. Hilmia plockar fram Blood Roots som hon har två av. Det var ok tydligen, och vi kommer få 5 potions of See Invisibility under morgonen.\nHon säger att vi ska KNACKA nästa gång.Vi går vidare. Cory säger att han gärna går till biblioteket, Hilmia vill gå till den där blomman hon fixat med tidigare. Jag o Tony drar o lägger oss.Hilmia kommer tillbaks med 1 Soul Coin.<br>\nTony ångrade sig och går iväg och tänkte prata med <a data-href=\"The Wizard\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The Wizard</a> o berätta om morgonens planer. Tog en stund men till slut hittade han vart han bor. Men den som öppnade dörren var en som såg ut som <a data-href=\"The Wizard\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The Wizard</a>, men hade ett kort svart skägg. De pratar lite.<br>Efter det går Tony hem och lägger sig. Vi alla sover och får en long rest. Sen drar Tony tidigt för att möta damerna och <a data-href=\"The Wizard\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The Wizard</a> omkring soluppgången. Tony är hans Wingman under detta, och bara efter en ganska kort stund lyckas <a data-href=\"The Wizard\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The Wizard</a> få till sig båda damerna och Tony lämnar och får lösenordet till labyrinten, som är ”Scissors”.<br>Vi samlar sen ihop oss för att sen ta oss till <a data-href=\"Aksayakumara\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/aksayakumara.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Aksayakumara</a>s ö. Väl framme ser vi att något hus bort är det ett hål i ett tak. Det ser ut som att det är intryckt ner i taket. Jag skickar iväg lilla Griffon som får kika lite uppifrån. Han ser att det är skitigt och ostädat där hålet är i taket. Takpannor och annat som bara ligger där.\nHan ser en tunna som står på högkant utan att luta sig emot något. Vi kommer på att vi glömde osynlighetspotionsarna. Hilmia springer och hämtar dem.Griffonen landar på taket och upptäcker att det är jätteklabbigt på taket. Jag trollar bort den och sen tillbaks så den är hos oss igen.<br>\nVi hör en någon som harklar sig bakom oss, <a data-href=\"Aksayakumara\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/aksayakumara.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Aksayakumara</a>. Han kommer fram och vi pratar kort, innan han behöver gå och drar iväg.Strax efter kommer Hilmia och ger oss potions. Jag Identifyar en av dem och de håller 1h och gör att vi kan se saker/varelser i the Ethereal Plane. Vi dricker var sin och börjar gå inåt. Cory hoppar upp på taket för att känna efter på klegget vi hittade. Vi andra tre går in genom ytterdörren. I ordningen Tony, Hilmia och jag sist. Cory möter oss och följer med in precis innan vi stänger dörren.När vi kommer in ser vi direkt 4 spindlar. De är passiva, neutrala, rör sig inte utan bara hänger där de är, uppe i taket typ 6 meter upp.\nJag känner att det inte är spindlar från the Material Plane. De är från nån annanstans. De är blanka och vita. Jag känner att detta är verkligen något jag nog kan använda till crafting eller annat. Vi funderar lite ifall vi kan ha ihjäl dessa 4 spindlar. Det var ju ETT monster vi skulle släppa fri/döda. Så det borde finnas någon större än dessa. Cory tror dessa kanske bara är barn typ, på sättet de är genomskinliga. Vi tänker vi väntar med att attackera dem. Vi försöker går under dem sakta men de verkar nog vara på att attackera. Efter vi gått förbi den första börjar den sakta sänka sig och fälla ut benen. fight börjarJag skjuter mot en av dem men de går bara igenom och träffar taket istället. Cory slog mot två av dem och samma sak där, går bara rakt igenom. <br>Efter en stund blir jag omringad av två spindlar. Sköt båda två, men det extra skottet från <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Items.canvas\" data-href=\"Items.canvas\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/01_pcs/singwin-mistwalker-folder/while-playing/items.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Gauntlets of Eldritch Ferocity</a> lossade inte som det skulle. Jag tar 26 damage (och tappar lika mycket max hp). Hela armen känns fruktansvärd. Det bränner och det känns som det suger ut kraften från den.\nTony kommer och hjälper mig så att jag inte blir spindelmat.Vi klår två av dem, och sen verkar Hilmia prata med de två spindlarna som är kvar. De verkar komma överens om att vi kan hjälpa deras mamma att komma ut. De två som var kvar slutade attackera oss och går mot hålet till källaren. Hilmia har en ring som hjälper henne från att fastna i saker och ting. och det hjälper henne att komma ner i hålet till källaren. Hon går ner och konverserar med mamma-spindel. Jag suger upp en av de döda spindlarna i väskan.Mammaspindel har blivit kallad hit och sen låst på plats med en magisk cirkel. Hon blev kallad av en kvinnlig lizard. Men hon har flytt platsen. Vi ser att det finns en hel del krukor. De har distortade ansikten och ser ut att vara i agony, smärta, hemskheter o annat. De ser torterade ut. De glimmar lätt i grön färg. Cory tycker inte riktigt om det och vill gärna kolla på en kruka. Hilmia hämtar en kruka och ger till Cory. Han observerar den och sen öppnar han den. Vi börjar höra lite röster och skrik från krukan, sen slänger han den i backen så den går sönder. Då hör vi alla höga obehagliga skrik och vrål av agony.Hilmia försöker övertala mammaspindel att förstöra alla krukor här nere. Det var inte helt lätt men hon accepterar, så länge vi hjälper henne först.\nJag slänger Dispel Magic och cirkeln försvinner. Mammaspindeln känner sträcker lite på sig och sen direkt börjar hon slå sönder alla krukor. Ett fruktansvärt skrik från hundratals själar hörs långväga. Såna fruktansvärda vrål från torterade själar.Sen sätter mammaspindeln benen på taket och sträcker sig IGENOM golvet upp till ovansidan av ladan. Phasear igenom golvet.Hilmia ber mig kolla ett rum en bit bort. Hittar inget av värde.\nCory ser inget och försöker tända en fackla i mörkret. Han misslyckas något för han råkar tända lite eld på spindelnät och det sprider sig fort.\nOjoj säger vi och börjar röra oss uppåt, iväg. Väl uppe märker vi att några av oss inte ser ut som vi har fightats alls. Tony och Cory ber mig skjuta dem så de ser lite skadade ut. Tony sticker lite i sig själv och Hilmia också för att se bitna och stuckna ut. Vi diskuterar igen om hur vi ska gå tillväga nu och än en gång är Cory och Tony inte överens vart vi ska gå eller vad vi ska göra.\nVi slutar med att vi springer ut och inte vet riktigt vad vi ska göra. Vi möts av nån person som frågar vad som hänt och Cory berättar att vi har slagits och att monstret har rymt och personen som frågade blir lätt uppspelt och går omkring och försöker lista ut vad vi ska göra för att lösa det. Han försöker få Cory att hänga med. Men sen springer frågaren iväg och vi börjar gå. Cory tar tag i en person till och berättar att monstrena är osynliga så de behöver potions. Personen gör nån magi för sina ögon och säger att ”ni hjälper väl till?” vi svarar att vi är skadade och vet inte om vi klarar det, ”men gå och hämta potions då” svarar han.\nMycket folk och ett par golems har börjat röra sig för att hantera detta.<br>Vi rör oss iväg och mot Cirkeln igen. Vi tänker att vi behöver berätta för <a data-href=\"Aksayakumara\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/aksayakumara.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Aksayakumara</a> vad som hänt. Vi letar upp honom och han är hos nån <a data-href=\"Zarah\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Zarah</a> som vi går till. Vi knackar på och tjänsteflickan hämtar <a data-href=\"Aksayakumara\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/aksayakumara.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Aksayakumara</a> efter att vi berättat att det är ganska bråttom.\nHan kommer och Tony berättar att vi gick in i ladan, möttes av två spindlar som vi hade ihjäl, Tony stannar kvar med två andra spindlar och vi andra gick ner mot mammaspindel. Den lyckades fly och den phaseade igenom marken. Sen stack den upp på taket och iväg. Vi kunde inte lösa det.\nVi såg den kort när den kom fram igen på ditt palats.<br><a data-href=\"Aksayakumara\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/aksayakumara.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Aksayakumara</a> blir rasande och säger ”Tack för ett försök, jag kommer aldrig be tjänster av er igen” och sen drar han.Vi börjar gå och en till sån stenfigur kommer ner och rycker i Hilmia och ger oss ett papper.\nI’ve already heard of the great success of your mission. Please arrive at the soonest possible time at the Forgery.<br>\nSignerat av <a data-href=\"Al-Riyada\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/al-riyada.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Al-Riyada</a><br>Vi fortsätter gå och hoppar på båten mot <a data-href=\"Al-Riyada\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/al-riyada.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Al-Riyada</a> igen. På båten försöker jag och Cory tillsammans stycka den spinden jag fångade upp. Går ganska dåligt så får inte så mycket användbart. <br>Vi går in i Forgeryt och får nu komma till stora salen. <a data-href=\"Al-Riyada\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/al-riyada.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Al-Riyada</a> är nöjd med vad vi gjort och frågar vad det var för monster. Vi berättar att det var en stor phaseande spindel. Vi säger också att alla krukor blev förstörda.\nHan ger oss vår betalning, 1 Soul Coin per person. Pratar lite skräp en stund. Han berättar lite om apan som ska hjälpa Tony med hans hand.<br>\n<a data-href=\"Al-Riyada\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/al-riyada.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Al-Riyada</a> är väldigt nöjd med det vi gjort. <br>”You are being watched, by me and <a data-href=\"Aksayakumara\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/aksayakumara.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Aksayakumara</a> ofcourse. But by a small party as well, that has been looking at you (Tony). Probably something about your mythical sword. But I warn you, do not mess with him. You can mess with <a data-href=\"Aksayakumara\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/aksayakumara.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Aksayakumara</a> but not with him.”<br>Tony blir lite orolig och ber mig hålla koll på svärdet. Så jag lägger det i väskan. <a data-href=\"Al-Riyada\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/al-riyada.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Al-Riyada</a> kommenterar det lite Infernal Iron, Starmetal. Han ber mig kolla på klumpen med starmetal. Kolla på den, inspektera och fundera på vad du kan göra med den. Vad är mest fitting för det. Jag har en bounty på mig tydligen. Berättar han. Om nån följer efter er så kommer någon av mina spioner, stengargylerna, att varna er. Slutligen åkte vi i en båt mot apan som ska ta emot Tony och vi andra får vänta medan Tony snackar med apan.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#session"],"headers":[{"heading":"Current agenda","level":2,"id":"Current_agenda_0"},{"heading":"Goals","level":7,"id":"Goals_0"},{"heading":"Session Summary","level":2,"id":"Session_Summary_0"},{"heading":"Recap of last session","level":2,"id":"Recap_of_last_session_0"},{"heading":"Log","level":2,"id":"Log_0"}],"links":["03_npcs/aksayakumara.html","04_places/shrivell's-reach/maraja.html","03_npcs/aksayakumara.html","03_npcs/aksayakumara.html","03_npcs/al-riyada.html","04_places/shrivell's-reach/maraja.html","03_npcs/al-riyada.html","03_npcs/al-riyada.html","03_npcs/aksayakumara.html","03_npcs/aksayakumara.html","03_npcs/aksayakumara.html","03_npcs/al-riyada.html","03_npcs/aksayakumara.html","03_npcs/aksayakumara.html",".html","03_npcs/aksayakumara.html",".html",".html",".html",".html","03_npcs/aksayakumara.html","03_npcs/aksayakumara.html","01_pcs/singwin-mistwalker-folder/while-playing/items.html","03_npcs/aksayakumara.html",".html","03_npcs/aksayakumara.html","03_npcs/aksayakumara.html","03_npcs/al-riyada.html","03_npcs/al-riyada.html","03_npcs/al-riyada.html","03_npcs/al-riyada.html","03_npcs/aksayakumara.html","03_npcs/aksayakumara.html","03_npcs/al-riyada.html"],"author":"Rasmus","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-40-2023-12-26.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":["05_quests/current-goals-singwin-mistforger.md","02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-39-2023-12-18.html"],"createdTime":1730964968185,"modifiedTime":1731699500927,"sourceSize":19751,"sourcePath":"02_Journal/Thalbrine - Big campaign/Session 40 - 2023-12-26.md","exportPath":"02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-40-2023-12-26.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":219,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-41-2024-01-05.html":{"title":"Session 41 - 2024-01-05","icon":"","description":"Session number: 58\nBörjade spela omkring: 16:30\nHitta ett sätt att få hem Holger\nFixa ett material med ursprung från the Astral Plane\nHälsa på Semil Wildmagic i Bastion Shore\nKomma på ett namn på byn där Cecil och Arvid finns ![[]]Tony kommer ut igen och är lite sårig o dan, liknande apan som också kommer ut.

Sen drar vi oss mot ståndet som har alla potions. Tony plockar två Potions of Superior Healing och dricker en av dem. Jag smörjer han lite med Keoghtom’s Ointment och sen bestämmer vi oss för att gå o vila en sväng. Hilmia håller utkik under tiden.<br>\nVäl lite mer utvilade drar vi oss för att försöka hitta <a data-href=\"The Wizard\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The Wizard</a>’s bror.

Tony frågar om bartendern har något uppdrag till oss, då svarar han att han vill se Tonys handled först. När han ser stämpeln på hans arm så tackar han nej. Cory går under tiden fram till tre män i liknande turbaner och ställer lite frågor. Han får lite svar men osäker på vad exakt.Tony berättar för oss att han inte fick ta nåt uppdrag här pga stämpeln. Cory går fram och frågar samma sak. Han får ett erbjudande för en nybörjare som gällde att oskadliggöra en dotter som har stulit saker. Han tackar nej snabbt.<br>Lite diskussion om uppdrag sker innan vi drar oss iväg till <a data-href=\"Mahmoud’s Mystic Arcanum\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/04_places/shrivell's-reach/mahmoud’s-mystic-arcanum.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mahmoud’s Mystic Arcanum</a>. Vi tror vi väntar lite med <a data-href=\"The Wizard\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The Wizard</a>’s uppdrag då han säkert är upptagen fortfarande. Det med Labyrinten föreslår Hilmia att vi göra sist av allt. Så vi tänker kolla med <a data-href=\"Mahmoud\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mahmoud</a> om hur det går med folk till worm-uppdraget.När vi kommer nära och kan se shoppen, ser vi nån form av kurir som när han ser mig, strikt springer fram till oss och tar fram ett pergament från sidan av sig. Han ser på mig och säger att detta är till mig, någon maskerad man hade gett honom det.Jag tar den och öppnar, och ser att det är Shimmers’ logga instämplat i längst ner på pappret. Detta står i brevet:\nLäs inte detta högt\nJag har kommit för att göra ett diskret besök med er i Maraja, men jag kan inte synas här och ingen kan höra mitt namn. Möt mig i kvällstid precis när solen går ner i horisonten. Jag finns i en undanskymd gömma, som ni kan komma till om ni klättrar ner i den mest norra delen av nedersta cirkeln.\nXX, GAlla läser brevet och sen berättar Tony vad det stod för mig. Vi har haft våra funderingar om han (Gideon) verkligen är en vettig person, men vi känner ändå att detta kan vara positivt för oss.<br>\nDå detta var när solen gick ner så tar vi <a data-href=\"Mahmoud\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mahmoud</a> först. <br>Vi går in till <a data-href=\"Mahmoud\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mahmoud</a> och han säger att han har skickat ett sändebud för ett par timmar sen till oss, som lär komma till oss snart. Han har hittat de 3 sista som behövdes och vi ska dra tidigt imorgon bitti, precis när solen går upp. Vi kan mötas inne på <a data-href=\"Mahmoud’s Mystic Arcanum\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/04_places/shrivell's-reach/mahmoud’s-mystic-arcanum.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mahmoud’s Mystic Arcanum</a> innan vi drar.<br>Folket han hittat är i grupper om 2, 2, 1, 1, så vi är definitivt den största gruppen. Vi får det vi behöver för uppdraget av <a data-href=\"Mahmoud\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mahmoud</a> imorgon <br>Tony frågar lite om att tradea nåt vapen med <a data-href=\"Mahmoud\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mahmoud</a> för att få nåt att ge apan. De diskuterar lite och <a data-href=\"Mahmoud\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mahmoud</a> säger att han har något som kallas för ”Elven glaives”. Jag tar fram bensvärdet och han accepterar det som utbyte för Elven glaive. Vi får den imorgon innan vi drar iväg på resan.<br>Tony frågar om en annan uppgradering till hans svärd och <a data-href=\"Mahmoud\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mahmoud</a> har ett annat erbjudande men skulle kosta 5 Soul Coins.Tony frågar lite om masken. Vi får veta att den har en gadd längst bak som har en del väldigt starkt gift som han rekommenderar att undvika.\nDet går inte att attackera med melee utan han rekommenderar att hålla sig på avstånd. <br>Vi går ifrån <a data-href=\"Mahmoud’s Mystic Arcanum\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/04_places/shrivell's-reach/mahmoud’s-mystic-arcanum.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mahmoud’s Mystic Arcanum</a> och framåt för att leta efter ledtrådar för att hitta <a data-href=\"The Wizard\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The Wizard</a>’s Simulacrum broder. Vi får lite hjälp men inget superkonkret.Vi går vidare till den nordligaste delen och funderar hur vi ska veta om detta är rätt ställe. Jag skickar min griffon som får kolla nedanför oss. Det verkar finnas något under bryggan som vi står på. Vi bestämmer oss för att jag slänger Fly med väskan på mig, Hilmia Gaseous Form på Tony och sen förvandlar sig själv till en spindel eller något och Cory dricker en Potion of Climbing. Sen drar vi ner. Hilmia klättrar upp på mig och lägger sig i en ficka. Jag känner lite på om Fly funkar, sen drar jag ett svandyk ner från kanten och in under bryggan. Vi alla tar oss ner relativt smidigt.Vi kommer till en dörr i en liten port. Dörren verkar olåst så vi öppnar den. Det ser ut att vara nån form av lastutrymme där inne, flertalet lådor och andra förvaringsgrejer finns där. Det är ganska mörkt, endast ljuset utifrån lyser in och lite ljus från lite längre in. När vi alla kommit förbi dörren så stängs den igen och en figur står vid dörren med en porslinmask över ansiktet.\nHan tar av sig masken och vi känner igen de två korta hornen i pannan, men annars är det inte helt lätt att känna igen, då det är helt andra kläder bl.a. Men det är Gideon.\nHan gestikulerar att vi ska gå inåt och vi följer detta. Vi går in i ett annat rum en bit bort och han stänger dörren efter oss.\nHilmia klättrar ur och unshapear. Gideon välkomnar oss och säger att vi måste ha många frågor, vilket han har också. Men först har han några gåvor till oss.\nHan tar fram ett litet skrin och ger till oss.\nNär ni gör ert mest riskfyllda uppdrag, ett inbrott om jag förstått rätt, var säkra på att ni ser allt som kanske är i vägen. Inte osynligt och inte illusioner.\nMan behövde ”sant seende” för att se vissa pusselbitar hos henne. ”Varför är du här?” frågar vi Gideon. Han säger att vi är gillets mest värdefulla äventyrare, speciellt sen vi fick tillgång till deras Teleportation Circle-system.\nAsken har spellen Instant Summons på sig och i asken ligger en Safir värd omkring 1000gp. Vad vi än sparar i den är ospårbart för även mindre gudar. Kan vara användbart om vi vill ta med oss något där vi inte vill att någon ska hitta det.Lite frågor ställs från oss till Gideon, angående delvis en historia som handlade delvis om någon med gyllene hy, lite frågor om hur länge han levt, om vi kan lite på honom o lite annat.<br>Tony ville prata lite själv med <a data-href=\"Gideon\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Gideon</a>, så vi andra går ut och väntar. Efter en stund kommer de båda ut och <a data-href=\"Gideon\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Gideon</a> tar på sig masken igen. Vi frågar vart man tar vägen om man går andra hållet, och då kommer man till bakom en bardisk. Han säger till sist att vi ska vakta våra ryggar imorgon, antagligen för de andra i teamet som ska ta ner masken.Vi tar oss upp igen med dubbla Gaseous Forms, Potion of Climbing och shapeshift. När vi börjar gå tillbaks till innet berättar Tony att kriget i Aarid Province har blivit värre. Folk i Heathshire har börjat evakuera staden, det är riktigt illa. Vi tänker gå o lägga oss, men Tony önskar ”fylla en kalkon” innan han går o lägger sig och jag föreslår att han säkert behöver hjälp, för klarar han det själv liksom? Förvånande nog, tycker han de låter rimligt och vi går för att ragga lite åt Tony.\nFörsta lyckas vi inte så bra med, men nästa går bra och Tony får sin girl for the night. Jag råkade imponera tillräckligt på en annan tjej för att ta lite drink o shot på närmsta baren. Sen drar vi hem o lägger oss igen.<br>Vi drar direkt upp till <a data-href=\"Mahmoud’s Mystic Arcanum\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/04_places/shrivell's-reach/mahmoud’s-mystic-arcanum.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mahmoud’s Mystic Arcanum</a> efter vi vaknar. När vi kommer dit ser vi 4 individer som väntar. En blek men samtidigt mörkhyad (?) alv mage med lång röd flytande rock. Två lite större figurer, en hobgoblin och en halvorch. Ena har två svärd vid midjan, den andra har en enorm båge. Den sista är en blond människa med en svart cloak, har ett djupt sår i handflatan. Han har två svärd på ryggen. Vi går o sätter oss och väntar lite.<br>\nEfter en kort stund kommer de två sista. Jag känner direkt igen en av dem, det är Tabaxin som tog väskan, den andra är garanterat den jag såg på taket. Han kollar på mig lite medan de kommer in. När de har kommit så får vi alla var sin från <a data-href=\"Mahmoud\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mahmoud</a> och vi alla dricker var sin. Vi hänger med <a data-href=\"Mahmoud\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mahmoud</a> ut och han leder vägen framåt.\nTabaxin går in jämte mig och säger att ”det blir väl trevligt att arbeta tillsammans?”. Jag svarar att ”njao det vet jag inte helt, vi får se”.\nT: ”Oroa dig inte, det uppdraget har vi lämnat ifrån oss, vi tyckte inte det riktigt… var värt besväret.”\nJag frågar vilka som har det nu och vem som gav uppdraget från början; Vilket han svarar att de inte vet, samt att det var ett uppdrag från tavernan. Han sa att belöningen var 3 Soul Coins när jag fråga. Jag påpekar att det var inte var så farligt mycket ändå. Han tyckte då att det var lite dumt sagt, och säger typ att ”man inte är lika kaxig när man har en kniv i ryggen”.<br><a data-href=\"Mahmoud\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mahmoud</a> när vi har börjat åka nedåt mot öknen berättar han lite om uppdraget. Han tar fram två flaskor som ska göra en högljudd smäll som masken blir intresserad av. ”Se till att när masken är död, att dens huvud är ovan mark så ni kan gå in och komma åt magvätskan”.<br><a data-href=\"Aymon\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Aymon</a> heter den magiska alven. Han kommer fram till oss och pratar lite. När vi kort in i konversationen kommer fram till att vi endast känt <a data-href=\"Mahmoud\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mahmoud</a> och befunnit oss i <a data-href=\"Maraja\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/04_places/shrivell's-reach/maraja.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Maraja</a> ett par dagar, vart det inte intressant längre och han går o pratar med andra.\nTony pratar lite med han som hade dubbla svärd på ryggen.<br>Vi pratar inte med någon mer efter detta. Bara iakttar och väntar på att vi landar. Vi kommer till någon grotta som inte verkade va tillräckligt bra så vi drar vidare och sen kommer vi fram till en bra plats och <a data-href=\"Mahmoud\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mahmoud</a> ropar på oss. Vi släpps av på en ganska stenig mark med en del stenpelare lätt utspridda runtomkring. <br>Vi sprider ut oss ganska bra på flera olika pelare. Jag står själv på min, Tony själv på sin, Cory och Hilmia står på en egen. Sen står de två med bruna käpor, alltså Tabaxin och dennes kompis, på en egen platå, och Halvorchen o Hobgoblinen på en platå. Till sist är magikern <a data-href=\"Aymon\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Aymon</a> flygande i mitten av de flesta pelarna och Blood Huntern står också på marken. combat begins ishHobgoblinen ställer sin båge vilande på platån. Sen tar han en glasflaska och kastar ner i backen en bit bort från platån. Vi hör ett högt högt buller och smäll och efter inte ens en minut ser vi ryggen av en enorm lila varelse som börjar komma upp ur öknen.\nNär huvudet har kommit upp börjar alla attackera den.Efter en kort stund springer Tabaxin och klättrar upp på pelaren som Cory och Hilmia står på och han prompt fortsätter med att knuffa ner Cory ner från pelaren på sanden och en ganska hög duns hörs genom marken.<br>Lite senare i fighten när Tabaxin fått lite besvär på den pelaren då Cory och Hilmia båda har slagit tillbaks, men även <a data-href=\"Aymon\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Aymon</a> har flugit dit och försökt stoppa honom. Tabaxin bestämmer sig för att jag är ett bra mål och drar till mig istället. Jag frågar hur han tycker det går för dem och han bara ler mot mig och leker med sin kniv i handen lite lätt. Jag tycker de verkar b så jag Thundersteppar (som då låter VÄLDIGT högt) till Tonys gamla pelare och sen flyger min griffon till Tabaxin och gör <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Items.canvas\" data-href=\"Items.canvas\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/01_pcs/singwin-mistwalker-folder/while-playing/items.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Hypnotizing Gaze</a> som lyckas så att Tabaxin blir incapacitated och inte kan röra sig.\nJacob tyckte detta var en VÄLDIGT bra/rolig play och jag fick en Inspiration.Tony fick en otrolig idé, när masken dök ner så slängde han en sån explosionspotion på ryggen av masken. Jag tyckte det verka najs så lät griffonen ta med en och släppa en till på samma ställe. Efter en kort stund är det bara svansen kvar och då kommer huvudet av masken upp och hugger tag där ljudet kom ifrån, numer svansen. Den biter sig i svansen och blir stucken i munnen av sin vassa giftiga ände. När fighten med masken är över, så har Tabaxin dött av delvis oss, men delvis masken som tog sig en tugga efter att jag frös honom. Utöver det har Blood Huntern attackerat Cory flertalet gånger. Även Tabaxins kompis har attackerat oss. Vi har fått hjälp mot dessa av Halv-orchen och Hobgoblinen. Den sistnämnda downade och jag hjälpte denne upp. Vi lyckas ha ner Blood Huntern också, men vi tappade bort den andra cloakade figuren. Hilmia försöker leta efter denne ett bra tag och följer ett spår hon tror hon har. Jag blir fundersam och kollar åt samma håll men ser inget. Provar Blink från väskan och då ser jag något vagt en bra bit bort. Berättar för Hilmia sen att han är långt bort men osynlig. Vi slutar jaga honom efter en stund. Cory och Halv-orchen kryper in med de 3 flaskorna i masken och fyller dem medan Tony och Aymon skär ut en poison-gland från taggen på svansen.<br>\nNär vi är klara skjuter vi signalen med den speciella staven och kort därefter kommer <a data-href=\"Mahmoud\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mahmoud</a> med sitt skepp och hämtar oss.Vi kommer upp och han är tacksam för uppdraget, och han kommenterar att vi saknar 3. Jag poängterar att en av dem har sprungit österut.<br>\nVi pratar lite betalning. Halv-orchen säger att då vi gjort ett bra jobb kan vi la få de 3 Soul Coinsen som de tre saknade skulle fått. Vi försöker övertala honom och till slut efter Tony sagt ett par saker och <a data-href=\"Aymon\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Aymon</a> något, så säger jag att vi är ju tre grupper och kan få ett Coin var, så blir det typ jämt. De andra går med på det och till slut även <a data-href=\"Mahmoud\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mahmoud</a>.

Hilmia och Tony pratar lite med Hobgoblinen och Halv-orcen. Frågar bland annat om de visste varför vi blev attackerade av de andra tre, vilket de inte visste. De frågar lite om hans vapen och han tar upp ena svärdet och på det ser Tony lite text på gammeldvärgiska, det står Shisui.\nEn av dem frågar om symbolen vi har på oss, Shimmers’ märket. Och vi berättar. Han frågar mer om gillet men Tony bestämmer sig för att ljuga och säger att han som ger uppdragen heter Benedikt, då <a data-href=\"Gideon\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Gideon</a> nog är lite kontroversiell.

Vi tänker vi fixar det på en gång med apan så börjar röra oss dit. Tar skepp mot <a data-href=\"Al-Riyada\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/al-riyada.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Al-Riyada</a>’s Great forgery och sen vidare till apan. Vi leds till <a data-href=\"Al-Riyada\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/al-riyada.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Al-Riyada</a> av en gargoyle.<br>\nHan välkomnar oss och frågar vad vi gör här. Tony säger att vi vill tillbaks till apan men då svarar <a data-href=\"Al-Riyada\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/al-riyada.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Al-Riyada</a> att hans del av uppgörelsen är gjord. Han vill ha något mer för att vi ska få låna hans gondol igen. Jag erbjuder en Potion of Clairvoyance och han accepterar det för att han ändå tycker om oss en del.\nEn gargoyle flyger till honom och han berättar sedan att vi har blivit förföljda av två bevingade bestar som verkade vara typ lite större imps. Han har hållit koll på oss ett par dagar och berättar därför nu som det är. Det är antagligen någon högre uppsatt som har skickat impsen, någon devil eller något kanske.<br>\nVi går efter det till gondolen och den åker bort till där <a data-href=\"Marukei\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Marukei</a> hör hemma. Tony går fram till han och visar upp vapnet vi fått tag i. Vi ser att han verkar spårrar med en golem. Han kommer sen fram till oss och tar emot Elven Glaive som vi tog med oss. Han ställer lite frågor om den och tar sedan med Tony in i huset.\nTony kommer ut strax därefter och ger mig ritningen och jag kikar på den. På ritningen finns alviska, men ovanför det finns något äldre oklart språk som inte ens Bagge vet vad det är. Tony säger att det endast är få som skulle kunna crafta den rätt. Jag säger att ja men då är jag säkert en av de få!\nMen Tony säger att han inte tror jag är rätt person för jobbet. Det tär hårt i mig och jag blir väldigt sårad av den kommentaren och ger tillbaks Tony ritningen och sätter mig sen långt bort i gondolen.\nNär vi kommer tillbaks går jag sist av gondolen sakta och Tony frågar vad det är med mig. Vi diskuterar och jag försäkrar honom att jag har koll på vad det är, vad som är svårt med det och hur man ska göra. Han tycker det låter vettigare än att jag säger att det ”är inga problem”.\nVi kommer överens och ber endast Tony säga att han vill att jag ska göra den åt honom. Vilket han gör. Han säger också att han litar på mig. Det lättar klumpen i magen jag fick. Vi går vidare och på vägen delar Tony ut sina Soul Coins till oss andra som har cursen kvar.<br>\nVi går mot <a data-href=\"The Wizard\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The Wizard</a>’s hus för att fråga lite om hans bror. Han var inte där, så vi går till baren istället.<br>\nDär inne hittar vi honom och pratar lite. Frågar om hans bror. Vi berättar att vi har en gissning att han kanske inte ser ut som sig själv. Det anser <a data-href=\"The Wizard\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The Wizard</a> är den bästa gissningen hittills. Kan han kanske se ut som någon han kände till innan han dog?<br>\n<a data-href=\"The Wizard\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The Wizard</a> får en tanke och ber oss hänga med honom när han snabbt drar iväg mot en båt som verkar vara hans. Medan vi åker chantar han på nån spell, och efter 30 minuter flyter vi iväg på riktigt.<br>\n”Ahh, peace at last.” säger <a data-href=\"The Wizard\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The Wizard</a>. Han tog oss hit så ingen annan kan lyssna in.<br>\nNär <a data-href=\"The Wizard\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The Wizard</a> lekte med sina magiker när de vart lite yngre. Hörde de rykten om någon Zarah Alfassi(?). Väldigt mäktig magiker. Hans bror skulle nog kunna uppnå samma kraft som henne. Kanske kan det vara så att Zarah inte är henne, utan att det är broderns simulakrum. Han önskar nu istället att vi ska stalka henne under 24h. Tony har fixat att vi ska få 3 Soul Coins för stalkingen. <br>Om det är simulakrumen, så behöver minst en gång per dag göra en ritual för att behålla formen som <a data-href=\"Zarah\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Zarah</a>. Det kommer finnas massa crimson weave i ådrorna på henne under ritualen, man ser ganska tydligt att det är just den ritualen.Mellan 10-15 brukar hon befinna sig hemma. Vi frågar efter lite hjälp kring arbetet. Kanske invis-potions eller annat.<br>\n<a data-href=\"The Wizard\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The Wizard</a> ska fixa det åt oss och vi får även Sending Stones att använda.\nHon är VÄLDIGT farlig. Kan förstöra hela distrikt eller öar bara sådär. Om vi skulle ha ihjäl henne kommer det skapa många politiska problem, hon betyder mycket för The Great Counsel. <br>Mer snack om <a data-href=\"Zarah\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Zarah</a> och hur vi ska göra. Vi råkar berätta att vi har ett inbrott att göra hos henne också. <a data-href=\"The Wizard\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The Wizard</a> tror att kanske finns det något annat undangömt där nere, som kan bevisa att hon inte är den hon säger hon är. Det är säkert mycket skydd och protections där nere.<br><a data-href=\"The Wizard\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The Wizard</a> har ett halsband, en av två halvor. Hans bror har andra halvan och de båda har alltid haft på sig dessa sen de fick dem från sin mor. <br>När vi är i valvet vill <a data-href=\"The Wizard\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The Wizard</a> att vi ska kolla efter en liten marmorpelare. En typ av skyddande spell på den. I närheten av den kommer flera magiska effekter att pågå. Stjäl inte den. Den uppehåller effekter som man har på sig om man befinner sig i rutan. <br>Tony lyckades övertala så vi ska få ett Soul Coin nu för det extra som <a data-href=\"The Wizard\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The Wizard</a> bad oss kolla.<br>Vi ska nu bara göra inbrott, inget stalkande, förutsatt att vi hittar något tecken på att <a data-href=\"Zarah\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Zarah</a> är simulakrumet. <br>Vi åker tillbaks och vi ska träffa <a data-href=\"The Wizard\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The Wizard</a> igen om 10 timmar.<br>\nUnder tiden så drar jag och Tony till <a data-href=\"Mahmoud\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mahmoud</a> för att kolla om trä och Ki-essence till handen vi ska fixa till Tony. Cory och Hilmia ska dra till <a data-href=\"Omar’s Garden\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Omar’s Garden</a> innan Hilmia ska ta en tupplur innan ikväll.<br>När vi kommer till <a data-href=\"Mahmoud\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mahmoud</a> säger min griffon på axeln att vi blivit förföljda en bra stund nu. Väldigt diskret klädd, ser manlig ut. Jag o Tony går vidare in ändå och hälsar på <a data-href=\"Mahmoud\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mahmoud</a> och vi börjar prata.Han har trä vi kan få, gratis. vi skulle vilja ha Plommonträ och det gick bra.<br>\nHan kan tänka sig göra Ki-essensen åt oss, utan betalning. <a data-href=\"Mahmoud\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mahmoud</a> tyckte att det är spännande och lärande att få försöka crafta. Den enda betalningen var att han önskade få tips från mig. Han önskade kolla lite på ritningen och det fick han göra en kort stund i alla fall, ville inte att han skulle spara den. Han gav tillbaks den ganska kvickt för han hade memorerat den sa han. Sen tackar han för att han fick kolla och han går iväg och försvinner bakom teleskopet. Hilmia och Cory möter upp oss och vi pratar lite om hur det gått, Hilmia berättar om uppdraget de fick om att leta upp en shipment som en courier (nu död) skulle kommit med, får 1 soul coin.Vi går till baren för att kolla bounties, då vi vart förföljda en stund. Tony pratar till hon i baren och hon visar honom att det finns en Bounty på en död Tony Waru, men framförallt att återföra hans ägodelar. 3 Soul Coins i reward.Jag går ut efter detta och börjar speja. Efter en stund kommer Cory och strax efter ser griffonen att figuren som följde efter oss innan är här nu. Tony frågar om nån annan enklare bounty som vi kan göra. Det finns en, en annan barkeep i nordligare delen av distriktet har gjort ett dåligt jobb. ”Gå till baren, ta hans huvud och ge till mig, simpelt.” säger hon i baren. 2 Soul Coins är det värt. Tony och Hilmia pratar om det. De hämtar oss och vi kommer fram till att det känns inte helt rätt så vi avböjer.Sen går vi iväg. Cory och Hilmia tänker gå o sova en sväng. Jag o Tony chillar i lobbyn till härberget vi sovit på tidigare. Ett tag efter vi suttit där kommer en väldigt fint uppklädd figur och närmar sig oss.\n”Angenämt” säger han, och räcker fram en pergamentrulle. Vi känner tydligen hans mästare ganska väl.\nTony rullar upp pergamentrullen och en mörk rök sprider sig snabbt upp över oss, och händer kommer upp ur pergamentet och tar tag i först Tony, och sen kommer fler händer som tar tag i mig och Hilmia också. De drar oss in och igenom pergamentet. Det är mörkt.Vi kommer till nån form av stort rum. Ett uppdukat bord finns med mycket mat på. Mängder av figurer, erotisk klädda, de har kluvna tungor och rör sig sensuellt runt om rummet. En större figur sitter på en tron en bit bort med en utklädnad som en kung. Helt röd hy, med två stora horn från pannan. Helt svarta ögon med endast brinnande orangea irisar.<br>\nHan välkomnar oss och ber oss sitta ner. Han vet vad vi ska göra inatt säger han och han önskar ha en bok från <a data-href=\"Zarah\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Zarah</a>’s valv. Den hör hemma i de eldiga planen. Om vi nekar, kommer han berätta för en bekant till honom att hans försvunna svärd är tillbaks i hans ägo.<br>\nHilmia vägrar acceptera det. Hon vägrar säga ”jag accepterar” som han önskar att alla vi tre gör. Cory är fortfarande kvar i <a data-href=\"Maraja\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/04_places/shrivell's-reach/maraja.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Maraja</a>.Vi lyckas övertala Hilmia och vi accepterar.<br>\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"The Horned Devil from Mar-Dekesh\" data-href=\"The Horned Devil from Mar-Dekesh\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Han på tronen</a> säger att det som kommer förhindra och besvära oss ikväll är något Abyssal. En stank finns på Hilmia som vem som helst kan känna av.Sen skickar han tillbaks oss och vi vaknar upp på samma plats som vi försvann på. Verkar inte som vi rört oss alls, utan bara sovit typ. Budet som gav oss pergamentet säger tack och sen går han sin väg. <br>Vi möts av Cory och sen går vi mot <a data-href=\"The Wizard\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The Wizard</a>. Vi berättar INTE vad som just hänt. Tony pratar lite, själv, med <a data-href=\"The Wizard\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The Wizard</a> om det som hände nyss. Han drar oss in i en gränd. Förklädnaden vi får kommer inte vara jätteövertygande, så ingen får inspektera oss för noga. Han slänger Seeming på oss och vi ser ut som vanliga medborgare med rockar och turbaner. Diskret för detta område och plats.<br>\nHan ger oss varsin Potion of Invisibility, mig en Scroll of True Seeing, alla var sin Scroll of Fireball. <a data-href=\"The Wizard\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The Wizard</a> lägger även True Seeing på mig direkt, håller en timme. Direkt märker jag någon form av spöklik figur som finns på ALLA hus runtomkring. De ser ut lite som gargoyles men de är lite tanigare. Någonting i mig känner ett otroligt obehag när jag ser dem, men kan inte pricka exakt varför, de är väldigt obehagliga.\nSer alla magiska items runtomkring som utsöndrar nån energi.\nSer prylar som använder Gravithurgy, en sjukt ovanlig typ av magi, för att hålla saker uppe i luften. <br>Efter detta säger <a data-href=\"The Wizard\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The Wizard</a> hejdå och vi lämnas för att göra uppdraget. Vi börjar gå iväg mot huset. Vi ser att ena arbetaren är på plats och arbetar i trädgården.\nJag med truesight ser en liknande obehaglig figur ovanför dörren till huset. Ser även saker som lyser lite i huset, till exempel nån form av stjärntecken i en tavla på andra våningen, som man inte kan se i vanliga fall. Ser dock bara typ 1/4-del av tavlan.Hilmia dödar en del av gräset i trädgården och efter en kort stund märker hon i trädgården detta och sticker strax iväg från bostaden. Hilmia och Tony sveper direkt sina Potions of Invisibility, medan jag frågar varför vi tar dem nu? Det var väl våran väg ut? Men jag o Cory dricker dem också så alla är på samma plan.\nVi går in och kommer till Gazebon, Tony säger ”Scissors” och direkt börjar det öppnas upp för en trappa i golvet. Det låter en del när stenen flyttar på sig. Vi går ner och den stängs av sig själv när vi kommit en bit ner. Det blir becksvart. Då tänds blå braziers en efter en längre och längre ner. Vi går långt långt ner.\nVi kommer till slut till en stor sal. Vi kommer in vid ena hörnet av en stor kvadrat. Väggarna är säkert 7-8 meter höga och högst där uppe finns det ljuskällor. Braziers fortsätter lysa upp framför oss och sen når de labyrinten som börjar lysas upp. Vi kommer till en T-korsning det första vi gör. Diskuterar lite och kommer fram till att Cory ska sketcha ner vägen vi går. Men innan så skickar jag upp min Griffon som får kolla ovanför väggarna. Den blir direkt stekt av en Fireball. Den såg att det var 4 Stora braziers med dödskallar i precis innan den dog. Vi börjar gå och Cory syns nu då igen. Vi andra är osynliga och håller oss nära. Vi pausar vid första svängen och då hör alla tydliga, rytmiska, stora, dunsar någonstans ifrån. Jag kollar in i svängen och kollar sen nästa sväng. I den sista svängen såg jag nån arcane-runa.\nVi går in i sväng 1 istället och går en bit. Kort bit fram trampar jag och Hilmia på en stenplatta som sjunker ner. Vi försöker hitta hur den funkar och Hilmia tror den utlöses när vi går av. Vi hittar lite småpryttlar vi stoppar in i små hål jämte plattan efter den tryckts ned som kanske kan hålla den kvar. Vi andra går förbi och Hilmia försöker hålla dem kvar medan hon går undan. Det går helt ok men inte toppen. Den är väldigt känslig.Vi går vidare en kort bit sen hör vi alla väldigt tydligt stampanden och andningar. Sen ser jag en stor yxa och nåt typ tryne. Vi alla backar bakåt. Jag tittar fram igen och ser någon stor stor varelse som mest är av ben och tunn hud. Den stannar och spejar mest runt hörnet.Vi ångrar oss och går tillbaks till starten och går rakt fram istället för höger och kommer till en låååång korridor. Direkt ser jag nån form av vägg som kommer trigga nåt, men vad vet jag inte. Den är typ 3 meter hög. Vi vågar inte riskera utan går tillbaks och hoppar över runan på marken istället. Vi går vidare försiktigt och hör snart samma stampanden igen. Jag går fram själv och ser ett lite större rum och även monstret igen. Han sniffar aggressivt. Känns som han känner någon doft av oss eller någon av oss. Går tillbaks och berättar men sen bestämmer vi att jag går och kollar lite framåt. Går långt åt höger och kommer till fler långa korridorer. Går tillbaks en bit och ser att han då går sakta mot där kumpanerna befinner sig.\nGår tillbaks till dem och vi tänker gå tillbaks och sen trigga arcane-fällan på vägen till där vi såg monstret sist.\nCory skjuter en pil i fällan och den exploderar i eld. Vi springer fort iväg till korridoren vi såg den sist. Samtidigt började betydligt tyngre och längre steg höras från monstret. Vi kommer till ungefär samma plats vi såg den sist när stampandet abrupt slutar höras. Vi stannar upp och börjar smyga igen. Vi går vidare en bra bit. Där ser jag sen något mörkt moln som nog är osynligt för de andra. Vi svänger precis innan fällan istället och går vidare där. Vi kommer till en annan sidogång där det är nån form av mörk skugga en bit in på väggen. De andra ser att det är en inristning i form av ett öga som sitter typ 2 meter upp. Om det är något som kan se, så ser den nog inte oss osynliga. Men Cory… Tänker att han kanske kan hoppa över ögat. Den kollar säkert snett nedåt mot marken. Han lyckas hoppa högt och förbi.\nInget verkar hända. Men vi hör snart stampanden igen, men långsamma. Vi går vidare och det är en lång korridor som slutar i en återvändsgränd…\nVi vänder tillbaks, men möts snart av monstret igen. Cory försöker backa tillbaks bakom hörnet men monstret hinner se Cory och skrämmer honom (Frighten). Hilmia försöker Charma Monster men det funkar inte. Jag summonar min Griffon igen. Både jag och Hilmia är därmed inte osynliga längre. Tony chillar mot en vägg.combat börjarHilmia förvandlar sig till björn och monstret går fram till oss och attackerar.\nMin Griffon lyckas inte Hypnotisera monstret, men jag lyckas Slow:a. Så vi lyckas ta oss förbi.\nTony springer igenom fällan som väntade och en grön slime-kub kommer från typ ingenstans. Han klarar sig och fortsätter springa.\nVi attackerar monstret lite och jag blir attackerad av slimen. Skjuter sedan monstret igen och sen Misty Steppar mot Tony. Cory hoppar över Kuben också.\nTony springer iväg själv, Hilmia är en gas i luften och jag o Cory försöker följa efter Tony.\nEfter mycket om och men där jag och Cory själva försökt hålla undan monstret, möter vi upp med Hilmia och kommer till en port. Jag ser även Tony där, fortfarande osynlig. combat slutarVi undersöker dörren en del och det finns symboler för varje skola av varje magi. Jag tror man kan snurra på cirklar som är på dörren. Det finns nån pil som täcker för en av symbolerna på ringen. Jag och Hilmia snurrar på första, den är trög men det går. När vi drar den till vad jag tror är rätt plats och det låter lite ljud. Sen snurrar vi vidare, med Cory också. De två sista klarar vi inte utan Tonys hjälp så han kommer och hjälper till.När vi löst alla ringarna sänks dörren ner i marken. Vi kommer till något mer större rum. Det finns 5 pediestaler med 1 bok på vardera. Vi ser över 150 Soul Coins som alla ligger runtomkring utmarkerade med lite text till varje.\nLängst bort finns en marmor-byst som det finns en läderhjälm på.\nVi letar lite efter den där marmor-pelaren som kunde vara besvärlig. Men hittar den inte i första hand.\nHittar en potion med någon bubblande grön potion. Jag ser uppe i ett hörn i en hylla, som en flaggstång utan flagga, i toppen är det ett glimmande runt öga som är lite genomskinligt. På pedistalen där hjälmen är ser jag flertalet runor på plattan den står på. Antagligen något försvar av något slag. Böckerna är otroliga att se på. En av dem rent av pulserar. En annan verkar röra sig. En dryper ut en känsla av att bli viskad i örat. De sista två har också starka och tilltalande effekter.\nLängsmed alla montrar finns runor med säkerhet av något slag. Bortsett från allt på hyllorna, de verkar vara fria.\nBerättar för de andra att det är säkerhet överallt på de flesta prylar. Berättar också om ögat jag såg och Hilmia tar tag i den och slänger iväg. Böckerna är inte försvarade på något sätt.\nCory berättar att han tappade sitt block någonstans i labyrinten. Det står saker i den som kan spåras till honom. Vi behöver med andra ord hitta den, och det direkt efter vi sticker härifrån. Ser att runorna runt hjälmen är en Disintigrate spell som antagligen kommer avlossa när man tar hjälmen. Kan nog ta bort den med en stark nog Dispel Magic. Men vi behöver kanske inte ta bort säkerheten då vi inte behöver röra hjälmen. Vi använder asken med stenen i och lyckas göra en märkning i nacken på hjälmen. Jag tar asken och lägger i mitt portable hole.\nSen kollar vi boken. Försöker ta reda på vilken det är.Cory frågar om varför vi ska ta en bok, jag svarar att vi fick ett uppdrag från väskan. Frågar de andra om vilken bok de tror det är vi ska ha. Kollar lite.\nTänker lite på böckerna och känner efter.\nDen svarta boken med viskningarna, den är väldigt obehaglig och det är den som känns mest hemsk och kanske är nog den som Tieflingen krävde. Men den känns helt cursed på flera sätt. En av böckerna känns som kopplad till Astral Plane på nåt sätt. Jag känner bara en stark känsla kring den att INGEN borde ha tillgång till den. Jag lyckas plocka upp den med Corys tomma oändliga påse, men råkar komma åt den och känner av kraften. Det känns som något otroligt starkt kommer hända om man öppnar boken. Det är en fruktansvärt stark kraft som man inte kan göra något åt när man väl öppnat, då är det försent.<br>\nJag anser att den verkar vara typ OK att ta i, så jag stoppar i den i Bagge och ber han skicka den till Stora G. Bagge klagar nästan på hur jag tänker, ”vilken KRAFT det var i denna boken. VARFÖR tog du inte den själv?” Jag svarar bara att ingen ska ha den kraften eller möjligheten för den magin. <a href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se?query=tag:inspiration\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#inspiration\">#inspiration</a> (om jag inte hade haft en redan) Hilmia försöker känna av magin (Detect Magic) och känner verkligen av stark magi som utsöndras från böckerna. Hon känner att den svarta boken skyltar med magi från ett annat plan. Den är inte härifrån.\nJag försöker fånga in boken med Corys väska och det går bra utan att nudda boken. Jag ber de andra att INTE ta i sina böcker, det kommer inte komma något bra av det. Hilmia tar i sin bok när jag tittar bort och jag skjuter en Eldritch Blast på henne för att knuffa bort henne från boken. Säger att ”INGEN ska ha kraften. INGEN!”\nMen alla tre säger att de vill ha sin bok, eller åtminstone ta i den. Jag varnar dem en gång till men de står fortfarande bakom deras åsikt.\nJag ger upp och säger att ”ni får ta om ni vill, känn på böckerna, men jag har varnat er”Alla tre tar tag i sina böcker. Tony känner på sin bok och stoppar kvickt ner den i väskan. Cory låter sin vara kvar, Hilmia låter sin vara kvar också.Vi går utåt en kort bit men hör än en gång stampande ljudet från monstret, men även ett annat mer jordbävningsliknande ljud.

Vi hör stampandet från Minotauren som kommer närmare.\nTony ställer sig åt sidan och öppnar boken han tog upp, den som tilltalade honom mest. Tar ungefär en minut och sen tappar han boken och det gyllene och guldiga i boken försvinner och blir svart.Tony får 2 ability points att öka och 2 skill proficienciesCory ser sen att Hilmia står inne i valvet med sin bok öppen. Tar också en minut. Jag frågar hur Tony mår efter han är klar och han känner sig bra, uppfylld på nåt sätt.Hilmia fick +2 i Wisdom och Find Familiar alltid prepared (m.m.)När jag pratat med Tony går jag in i valvet för att kolla potionsarna och säger till Cory att Tony verkar må bra. Då går Cory prompt och öppnar sin bok. Jag frågar Hilmia sen hur hon mår, och hon tycker de känns som att cursen har förändrats, att tiden har gått för den också.Jag Identifyar den gröna potionen, Potion of Excessive Energy under tiden Cory läser sin bok. Kollar även nästa potion vi hittade, en svart. Cory fick 1 ability point och en advanced techniqueDen svarta potionen är en Potion of Demonic Blood. Den gör en stark men man blir exhausted och cursed efter en stund. Under tiden berättar Griffonen att Minotauren snart är här. Den svarta potionen tar jag inte med, men jag tar den andra potionen och en en scroll som såg spännande ut. Den hade text som stod på Rakash. Vi går sen ut till Tony som står och väntar på att vi ska dra, han verkar redo. Hilmia skickar ut ett gäng vargar för att försöka locka iväg minotauren. Direkt efter krönet hör vi att flera vargar dör men ett par fortsätter skälla och försöka locka Minotauren. Den tar ett steg in mot oss och kollar men verkar inte se oss och han går tillbaks. Då börjar det vibrera i marken igen och den öppningen som finns börjar resa sig. Vi klättrar upp på den och går vidare. Fortsatt så går vi vidare och försöker hålla oss på banan vi började på. Mer och mer börjar det visa sig och det är inte en labyrint längre utan ett mycket större ganska öppet fält.\nSkickar Griffonen mot anteckningsboken som Cory tappade tidigare och han lyckas hämta den. Men upptäcker att golvplattorna börjar vända på sig och istället för platt golv kommer massa ben och stora spikar vändas upp. Jag berättar för de andra och vi klättrar upp på väggen igen som är på väg att åka uppåt. Vi ser att i hörnet på vägen som vi kommer stå på snart finns det en stor sten som brinner med en stor låga. Vi kommer upp och väggen vi står på stannar. Vi ser en ganska stor obelisk av något slag med en dödskalle ovanpå. Hela stenen och dödskallen brinner.\nDå jag readyat en Eldritch Blast så skjuter jag stenen. En del från stenen försvinner, men väldigt lite. Tänker att det säkert är lugnt så jag går framåt med Dodge och de andra hänger på. Efter en kort stund skjuter den ut en eldboll som träffar mig. Bränner lite men inte så farligt.\nVi försöker sen ta oss fram och ta sönder obelisken. Vi går närmare obelisken. Medan vi går klättrar det upp mängder av skelett (typ 36) upp på plattformarna framför och bakom oss.\nJag tar fram scrollen jag hittade och visar för Tony som läser ”Holy Aura”. Jag använder den direkt och lyckas. Vi försöker fortsatt ta oss framåt. Jag slänger en Fireball där det är flest skelett och alla exploderar. Fortsätter framåt efter det och går förbi obelisken som Tony slicar dödskallen av. Den exploderar och vi tar en del skada allihop. Vi lyckas ha ihjäl alla skelett som fanns här uppe och vi går sen vidare mot vad som verkar vara typ en arena.\nNere i arenan står Minotauren som verkar le mot oss. Den verkar vänta. Den har blod runt sina bracers, verkar se ut som bröstkorgar som sticker in i hans grova underarmar som blöder kraftigt. En stor yxa i ena handen och från handen som håller den kommer det eld till och från. Den har en näsring som det verkar komma eld ifrån. Det finns en lätt pöl med blod där han står. Vi ser att Minotauren tittar på oss och ler. Den börjar snurra på handtaget på sin stora yxa för att byta mönster på handtaget. Efter en kort stund börjar golvet att luta där vi står och vi faller in mot arenan. Jag och Hilmia trillar ner medan de andra två ställer sig på benen.\nSen börjar vi fighta Minotauren på riktigt. Tony tar sig fram och doppar handen i Minotaurens blod\nAdamantios heter den. 86 år gammal.\nHar inga resistances inately, men något i dens blod ger den resistant mot allt utom Psychic. Den är Humanoid. AC 18. Vi attackerar lite men märker snabbt att han är väldigt kraftfull.\nTony ropar till den med dens namn, Adamantius och då rycker den till. Tony säger ”vi kan hjälpa dig att bli fri. stampa två gånger om du vill bli fri!”. <a data-href=\"Adamantius\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Adamantius</a> börjar stampa, två stamp är mycket starkare och sen fortsätter den stampa. Tony säger mer och försöker övertyga honom om att vi kan hjälpa honom om han kan hjälpa oss ut. Kort senare börjar <a data-href=\"Adamantius\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Adamantius</a> röra sig iväg och går till en obelisk som skjutit på oss.Efter det kommer det ett gäng skelett ner i arenan, och utöver det, en större i rustning. Kanske är en commander av något slag..<br>Vi har väldigt kämpigt i hela fighten och flera av oss downar flera gånger. Hilmia downar två gånger, Cory två gånger också. Jag går ner på under 10% hp. Men till slut är det bara vi 4, <a data-href=\"Adamantius\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Adamantius</a> och Commandern kvar. Tony har hjälpt till att försöka dra bort de bracers som <a data-href=\"Adamantius\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Adamantius</a> har, och lyckas med en av dem. <a data-href=\"Adamantius\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Adamantius</a> drar sen och hugger i Commandern. <br>Commandern drar iväg och <a data-href=\"Adamantius\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Adamantius</a> hänger efter.

Efter mycket om och men så lyckas Tony.<br><a data-href=\"Adamantius\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Adamantius</a> vrålar, skriker, gnyr, ylar och faller ner på knä.<br>Jag lyckas hålla Cory och Hilmia stable, men jag blir attackerad och downar också. Tony och <a data-href=\"Adamantius\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Adamantius</a> löser de sista och Tony väcker oss efter fighten är slut. Jag, Cory och Hilmia är på 1 hp. <br>Vi börjar prata med <a data-href=\"Adamantius\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Adamantius</a>. Vi frågar om han kan ta sig hem, men han hör hemma på en värre plats än detta, då han är ett barn av Baphomet.\nHan verkar inte ha något minne från sina tidigare liv.\nHan tar bort näsringen och slänger på marken, och säger att det är den enda gåvan han kan ge oss som inte är cursed.<br>När vi frågar berättar han att det finns någon annan väg ut. Det finns två utvägar och en ”gate” (gissningsvis en magic cirkel kanske), men den vet bara <a data-href=\"Zarah\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Zarah</a> om hur man hanterar.\nHan vrider på sin yxa igen och det låter lite i ett av hörnen vi inte vart i än.<br>\n<a data-href=\"Adamantius\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Adamantius</a> frågar om vilka han har slagits mot, det kan ju inte vara vi, för då borde vi vara döda. Vi säger att han slogs mot oss först, men vi lyckades få över honom på vår sida ish, sen slogs han bara mot skeletten och den där commandern.Han säger att de vi slagits mot kanske har något värdefullt på sig, han ville springa och hämta. Vi kollar under tiden lite på näsringen och den kommer nog göra personen som bär den starkare. Vi frågar lite om Zara, och det enda han vet är att under de 70 år han vart här har hon inte förändrats alls. Vi säger att vi kan ta bracersarna och skicka iväg dem så ingen får dem igen. Han tycker det låter väldigt bra, men han vill inte röra dem, de är väldigt cursed och sätter sig på någons handleder om de vill ha en ny ägare.\nVi går till dem och jag gräver upp dem med väskan Vi går utåt och vi pratar lite om det kan finnas nåt i valvet som hjälper honom. Han frågar om vi behöver något därifrån, isf kan han lösa fällorna. Vi säger att det fanns ett gäng scrolls som kan vara bra, annars är det nog lugnt. Han springer och hämtar dem; Prismatic Spray, Antilife Shell, Maze och Finger of Death.Sen går vi vidare och kommer till en kloak. Vi rör oss en bra bit i dem. Sen ser vi patrullerande golems en bit bort, och det är nog stads-golems. Vi försöker gömma oss och ta en annan väg. Vi låter lite och golemsarna stannar upp och går sen upp fortare.<br>\nVi klättrar upp och kommer upp på gatan. Vi står nu precis utanför grannen till <a data-href=\"Zarah\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Zarah</a>. Vi siktar på att gå till Ahmed, historiken som ville ha hjälmen i valvet. På vägen dit går vi förbi potiontanten och jag o Cory dricker var sin Superior Healing Potion. <br>Sen kommer vi till <a data-href=\"Ahmed\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ahmed</a> och han hälsar på oss och tar oss till ett annat ensamt rum. Vi småpratar lite och sen tar vi fram kristallen med Instant Summons och visar för honom. Han fattar inte helt så jag krossar safiren och hjälmen kommer till oss. Han tittar på den, tar upp den och identifyar den och sen slänger han 5 soul coins till oss.\nHan är tacksam och säger att det måste varit en väldigt spännande historia som han mer än gärna lyssnar på om det är så att vi vill dela med oss. Om vi vill det så får vi gärna komma tillbaks imorn så lyssnar han. Vi funderar lite på hur vi ska göra nu. Han hjälper oss genom att öppna en annan dörr som går till biblioteket, väl där stänger vi av Seeming. Sen går vi ut och direkt kommer den där snubben som verkade va ett sändebud åt en devil.\nHan tar med oss upp nån våning och sen upp i en hiss. Snubben öppnar sen en portal till The 9 Hells och ber oss gå in. Cory frågar massa frågor och oavsett vad vi säger blir han osäker och ber oss förklara mer. Vi försöker berätta lite men Cory tänder till och frågar varför vi inte har berättat tidigare. Snubben som tog oss dit ber oss att gå in, vi gör det med Cory strax bakom.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#session"],"headers":[{"heading":"Current agenda","level":2,"id":"Current_agenda_0"},{"heading":"Goals","level":7,"id":"Goals_0"},{"heading":"Session Summary","level":2,"id":"Session_Summary_0"},{"heading":"Recap of last session","level":2,"id":"Recap_of_last_session_0"},{"heading":"Log","level":2,"id":"Log_0"}],"links":[".html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html"],"author":"Rasmus","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-43-2024-01-28.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":["05_quests/current-goals-singwin-mistforger.md"],"createdTime":1730964970818,"modifiedTime":1731699500945,"sourceSize":10265,"sourcePath":"02_Journal/Thalbrine - Big campaign/Session 43 - 2024-01-28.md","exportPath":"02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-43-2024-01-28.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":222,"backlinks":["01_pcs/singwin-mistwalker-folder/character-sheet.html","01_pcs/singwin-mistwalker-folder/while-playing/character-sheet.html"],"type":"markdown"},"02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-44-2024-02-04.html":{"title":"Session 44 - 2024-02-04","icon":"","description":"Session number: 58\nBörjade spela omkring: 15:38\nHitta ett sätt att få hem Holger\nFixa ett material med ursprung från the Astral Plane\nHälsa på Semil Wildmagic i Bastion Shore\nKomma på ett namn på byn där Cecil och Arvid finns Vi kom till The Nine Hells och blev ledda till <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"The Horned Devil from Mar-Dekesh\" data-href=\"The Horned Devil from Mar-Dekesh\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">snubben på tronen</a> som gav oss questet att hämta den cursade boken. Vi ger han boken, han är nöjd med detta och ber oss dra och hoppas vi aldrig ses igen.

Där beter sig folket lite konstigt och de verkar försöka gömma sig. Det är nån filur från <a data-href=\"The Rooks\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The Rooks</a>, och antagligen han som vill ha Tonys svärd. Han verkar inte veta att det är oss han letar efter så vi klarar oss.

Men väl talandes med <a data-href=\"The Wizard\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The Wizard</a> visar det sig att han inte alls har hjälpt oss med spells och andra förberedelser inför valv-rånet. <a data-href=\"The Wizard\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The Wizard</a> kände inte heller till något om nåt halsband som vi fick uppdrag att leta efter. Vi alla är nu ganska säkra på att den vi pratade med då var <a data-href=\"The Wizard\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The Wizard</a>'s bror, the Simulacrum. Hos <a data-href=\"Sami\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Sami</a> lägger han Wish på oss tre för att vi ska bli av med cursen och det fungerar, vi är fria. Vi funderar på att hjälpa <a data-href=\"The Wizard\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The Wizard</a> med the Simulacrum och så länge drar vi till <a data-href=\"Mahmoud’s Mystic Arcanum\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/04_places/shrivell's-reach/mahmoud’s-mystic-arcanum.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mahmoud’s Mystic Arcanum</a> och säljer lite pryttlar och köper bl.a. manteln till Hilmia som hon suktat efter. Även en chestplate till Tony köps in. När vi pratar med <a data-href=\"Mahmoud\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mahmoud</a> kommer vi på att vi faktiskt skulle få en Ki-essence av honom, som nu är klar och vi får den. Cory är sugen på något/några items men klarar inte att ta beslutet för att köpa. Jag drar sen till <a data-href=\"Ahmed\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ahmed</a> och köper en Wand of Jump för 1 Soul Coin och ger till Cory så han kan bli av med sin ring. Vi ångrar oss sedan kring <a data-href=\"The Wizard\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The Wizard</a>s uppdrag och träffar honom en snabbis innan vi går till kajen där skepp mot ytan går. När vi ska lägga oss får jag mha Bagge besöka <a data-href=\"Stora G\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Stora G</a> och får en kort dialog med han <a data-href=\"#Meeting with Stora G\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-44-2024-02-04.html#Meeting_with_Stora_G_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Meeting with Stora G</a>\n![[]]Vi kommer till en ganska stor kvadratisk sal med väääldigt högt tak. En hel drös med takkronor och andra möbler. Vi kommer till en trappa som leder typ utomhus. Det finns braziers med stora röda eldar i som tintar allt runtomkring till orange, brun och rött.En annan herre än den som ledde oss in möter oss typ här. Jag ser att han har ett svärd vid sidan med någon form av symbol på, men kunde inte se vad för symbol det är.\nVi går på broar som hänger över flytande lava. Vi ser ett gäng andra byggnader, lite liknande den som vi kom ut ur. Kanske även de är portaler av något slag. Vi leds en bra bit bort och kommer till slut till en stor metallport. Det står två cambion vakter med full rustning som slår två gånger i marken när vi med vår guide kommer nära. Dörren öppnas och vi går uppför en stor trappa med enmeters djupa steg. En stor röd matta leder upp till en tron där den där figuren vi mötte förra gången sitter igen. ”Hejhej” säger jag mot han på tronen. Alla cambions och andra som är runtomkring reagerar på detta och börjar röra sig mot oss. Men han på tronen lyfter bara sin hand och alla stannar.\nHan som ledde oss går framför oss och räcker sin hand. ”Varan” säger han.\nJag ber Cory ta fram påsen med boken i. Han tar sakta fram påsen och ger mig en lite obekväm blick. Jag säger att vi berättar allt sen.\nJag ger påsen till han och han bär upp den. Han på tronen tackar. Han tömmer boken ur påsen och rör inte boken själv. Vi får påsen tillbaks.\nHan på tronen var nöjd att vi löst detta, det kan inte vart så osmidigt tyckte han, vi var ju ändå där. Jag svarar att det som var meckigt var att inte röra den. Han som guidat oss säger att han tror väl att vi hittar vägen tillbaka själva och sen börjar vi gå.\n”Jag hoppas innerligt att vi aldrig ses igen” säger han på tronen.\n”Detsamma” säger vi och går ut.Vi kommer till en trappa en bit bort och möter ett gäng figurer. En ogre typ som bär nån form av transport-stuga. Som en vanlig carriage fast på en ogre’s rygg. De är på väg ner för trappan och vi väntar tills de kommer ner, istället för att gå i mellan dem. De ger oss tydliga blickar när de passerar också. Vi kommer till porten, men den är stängd, den lyser inte längre som den gjorde tidigare. Det står en filur vid sidan av med lite lädrig utrustning. Han är fullständigt fryst och rör sig endast när vi kommer. Jag säger ”ursäkta, vi vill till Maraja”.\n”Ma ra ja” säger han och vänder sig om och fixar o donar lite på porten. När han är klar så säger han det igen och gestikulerar åt oss att gå in.Vi går igenom och är tillbaks på Maraja. Vi är i en sån där hiss igen där en gigantisk colossus flyttar på oss till toppen av Upper Circlen. Vi börjar gå mot Sami. På vägen berättar vi lite om vad vi faktiskt har gjort här. Cory tycker det kändes tråkigt att vi inte berättade men vi försökte göra det bästa av situationen.Typ halvvägs märker vi tydligt att alla runtomkring börjar gå mot sidan av vägarna och även lite in i husen. Vi hänger på och försöker smälta in lite i folkhaven. Vi ställer oss vid en gränd där det är lite mörkare. Vi ser att inget händer på gatan. Inget. Alls. Tony försöker se vad som händer. Jag slänger min Scroll of True Seeing och ser inte heller någonting speciellt. Vi följer gränderna och försöker hålla oss borta från vägen.\nEfter en stund ser vi nån gå. En stor svart och tjock man runt huvudet. Han har felvända händer så som Rakshasas har. Det lyser något gyllene sken från hans ögon, hans mun och botten på hans fötter.\nHan går väldigt tyst och spanar omkring sig. Alla som ser honom på gatan drar sig undan, iväg.Han blickar in i gränden vid ett tillfälle och rakt på oss. Vi får som en strålkastare på oss. Då stannar han till en kort stund innan han tyst går vidare. <br>Efter ett gäng minuter börjar folk gå utåt igen och prata lite kort. Vi går fram och frågar en person om vem det var. Han säger att det var en av ”<a data-href=\"The Rooks\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The Rooks</a>” (stavning?). De står ovanför allt och alla i <a data-href=\"Maraja\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/04_places/shrivell's-reach/maraja.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Maraja</a>, även de mörka magikerna. De har någon enstaka annan som står ovanför dem, även de är Rakshazas. Tony har fått höra tidigare från <a data-href=\"Ahmed\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ahmed</a> i biblioteket att Bakasura (eller va han hette) är en av The Rooks. Han vi såg, kan vara Bakasura som då letar efter Tony för att få tag i svärdet.<br>När folk börjar gå ut igen så går vi mot närmsta taverna som visar sig vara den som <a data-href=\"The Wizard\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The Wizard</a> brukar befinna sig i. Vi går in och möter han och ber om hjälp att komma till <a data-href=\"Sami\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Sami</a> igen. Han är stupfull. Han sänker sitt sista glas innan han går med oss ut. <br>Vi berättar lite om inbrottet men han fattar ingenting. Vi diskuterar lite. Vi kommer fram till att han som har hjälpt oss bryta in ÄR brorsan och det var inte <a data-href=\"The Wizard\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The Wizard</a>. Han känner inte till något halsband som de skulle fått av deras morsa, då de aldrig kände sin morsa.<br>\nVi fortsätter prata och försöker förstå vem som faktiskt är den äkta <a data-href=\"The Wizard\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The Wizard</a>.\nTony låtsas att han råkade snitta upp hans hand lite och täcker sen sin hand med blodet som rann ut.<br>\nTony ser att han inte har något födelsenamn, utan bara en pseudonym, <a data-href=\"The Wizard\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The Wizard</a>. Han är 232 år gammal. Resistance mot all non-magical physical damage. Vulnerable till Force damage. Blodet var rött.\nHan har inget riktigt namn, inget True name.<br>Tony berättar för <a data-href=\"The Wizard\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The Wizard</a> att det inte var ett misstag för att skära upp hans hand, utan det var för att ta reda på om han var på riktigt. Sen frågar Tony om varför han inte har något True name. Han berättar att han en gång hade ett namn, men han försakade det för länge sen, den enda som kände till det var hans bror.Han frågar efter en stund vad för inbrott vi gjorde och vi berättar om lösenordet han hade hjälpt oss med. ”Oh shit you actually did that?”. Vi säger ja, och berättar lite kort om vad vi faktiskt gjorde och tog där nere. <br>Kort efter kommer båten och på den står ingen mindre än <a data-href=\"Aksayakumara\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/aksayakumara.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Aksayakumara</a>. Han tittar bara mot oss när han går av och iväg, och vinkar lite lätt hej.<br>\nVi går på båten efter honom och börjar resan mot <a data-href=\"Sami\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Sami</a>.Vi möter hans blick när vi kommer fram och han ser på oss och säger ”Är det dags?”. Vi säger ja, och ger han våra 15 Soul Coin. Han tar dem och de försvinner upp i rök. Sen frågar han ”Vad är eran önskan?”, vi svarar att vi vill bli av med Cursen. Han slår ihop hans händer och sen sträcker dem mot oss och vi kan knappt andas. Vi lyser upp i vitt ljus och en mörkröd fog kommer ur vår kropp och vi alla tar ett sinnesjukt djupt andetag. Och väl taget, känner vi att tyngden är borta. Cursen, är borta.<br>Ställer fråga om <a data-href=\"Aksayakumara\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/aksayakumara.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Aksayakumara</a> har vart här, men <a data-href=\"Sami\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Sami</a> säger att\nVi frågar om vi får stanna kvar en stund. Han säger ja, och säger att vi gärna får stanna och röka med honom. Vi gör detta och får en short rest. Här låser jag även upp en del av de nya spellsen jag ska få från väskan efter att jag matade den med boken. Dimension Door och Divination<br>Vi ger lite items till <a data-href=\"The Wizard\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The Wizard</a> som identifiar endast Circleten, Circlet of Intellect. Näsringen och handsken ville han inte kolla på. Jag frågar Sami lite om Ki-essence. Han kan fixa en åt mig för 2 Soul Coins. Han tror inte att de har information om det på biblioteket, men är inte helt säker. I övrigt tror han att information finns i The Outlands. <br>Vi ger <a data-href=\"The Wizard\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The Wizard</a> en av våra resterande Sending Stones vi fick från hans (antagligen) bror, och vi ger också Corys armband som Hilmia har på sig, så vet vi när vi träffar en annan som ser ut som The Wizard ifall det är den rätta eller ej om den har armbandet eller ej. Om vi träffar honom, så kan vi säga till den riktiga <a data-href=\"The Wizard\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The Wizard</a> genom en Sending Stone.<br>Vi tänker vi drar till <a data-href=\"Ahmed\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ahmed</a> och kollar om att sälja några scrolls, och sen till <a data-href=\"Mahmoud\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mahmoud</a> o kolla om vi kan sälja lite grejer så Hilmia kan köpa sin grej.<br>Vi drar till <a data-href=\"Ahmed\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ahmed</a>. Han kan tänka sig köpa lite scrolls. Han känner en från The Outlands som kanske har koll. Det är en varelse som heter <a data-href=\"Marokei\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Marokei</a>, alltså apan. Han gav oss inte så mycket info sist.\nGer han scrollsen och han kollar på dem. Han frågar vad för spells vi vill ha tillbaks. Vi säger att vi vill ha Soul Coins, vilket han helst ville undvika. Han hade dåligt med Soul Coins så han går till sin kollega. De skriker på varandra och sen kommer kollegan. Vi diskuterar massor med han.\nVi kommer till slut fram till att om han får se vår Fairy Dragon, så köper han de 4 scrollsen för 3 Soul Coins.Cory ber Holger komma fram och kollegan kollar, och slänger nån spell och blir helt tokig. ”WhaT!!??@# You have a dragon?!”.\nHan betalar sen 3 Coins för scrollsen. <br>Vi pratar lite kort med <a data-href=\"Ahmed\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ahmed</a> innan vi går, och frågar bl.a. om en väg för att komma ner på ytan igen. På östra sidan finns det stationerade skepp. Det är frilanskaptener som tar en vart man vill för en betalning. De kommer ta 1 Soul Coin för att ta oss till ytan.<br>Vi går till <a data-href=\"Mahmoud’s Mystic Arcanum\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/04_places/shrivell's-reach/mahmoud’s-mystic-arcanum.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mahmoud’s Mystic Arcanum</a>. <a data-href=\"Mahmoud\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mahmoud</a> står där han brukar. Hilmia säger att hon vill köpa, men hon har bara 3 Soul Coins och tänkte erbjuda sin stav som ersättning för det 4 myntet. Han godkänner det. Han låser upp montern och Hilmia går bort och tar i Hide:n. Hilmia gråter när hon tar den. <br>Jag frågar om Ki essence, och han säger att han har gjort klart den som han skulle göra åt oss. (vilket vi glömt typ helt.) Det är från [Session 42](<a data-href=\"Session 42 - 2024-01-12#^gratiskiessence\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-42-2024-01-12.html#^gratiskiessence\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Session 42 - 2024-01-12 &gt; ^gratiskiessence</a>). Så han ger den till oss. <br>Vi kollar på lite saker att sälja och köpa. Frågar mycket och länge om olika items och vad han har till oss osv. Han låter oss Identifya näsringen och handsken också. Näsringen sparar Cory och handsken säljer vi till <a data-href=\"Mahmoud\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mahmoud</a>. Vi köper en Phoenix Breastplate till Tony och säljer blandat bröte för 1 extra coins.<br>\nSen går jag och köper en wand hos <a data-href=\"Ahmed\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ahmed</a> med Jump på och ger till Cory. <br>Vi tror vi borde dra snarast möjligt. Så vi skickar ett meddelande till <a data-href=\"The Wizard\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The Wizard</a> att han gärna får komma ner till oss så vi kan dra sen. Han svarar att han tänker INTE bli behandlad som en hund som bara kommer på beställning, men han kommer till oss.<br>Vi går in på <a data-href=\"Mahmoud’s Mystic Arcanum\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/04_places/shrivell's-reach/mahmoud’s-mystic-arcanum.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mahmoud’s Mystic Arcanum</a> och chillar en stund tills <a data-href=\"The Wizard\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The Wizard</a> kommer, 45 minuter senare.<br>Han berättar om att han såg nån filur som alla andra på gatan undvek. <a data-href=\"The Wizard\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The Wizard</a> tyckte han såg lite weird ut, men han gick bara förbi.\nHan erbjuder en liten betalning för informationen vi har delgett. 2 Soul Coins, vi trycker upp det till 3 Soul Coins av misstag och sen drar vi till skeppen. Väl ute på bryggan berättar de att vi får flyga men det kostar lite Coins. Typ 1-2 per dag flygtid, ish. Vi får en long rest och jag får resten av alla uppgraderingar till väskan jag låst upp När vi ska lägga oss hänger jag upp Bagge på en krok i mitt egna rum. Han pratar med mig.\n\"Duueehh, Stora G är väldigt nöjd med ditt arbete och med mängden grejer du har skickat över till honom. Kom närmare, och stoppa ner dina händer i mig\" säger Bagge medan han öppnar upp sig. <br> Ett starkt blått sken skiner ur Bagge och vad som än var inuti börjar röra sig utåt. Allt sväljs och täcks av detta skenet och en kort stund senare är det som att vi är i en annan dimension. När jag kollar bortåt ser jag en siluett av en stor griffon, med 6 armar. Det måste vara <a data-href=\"Stora G\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Stora G</a>.

Vi alla är nu ganska säkra på att den vi pratade med då var <a data-href=\"The Wizard\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The Wizard</a>'s bror, the Simulacrum. Hos <a data-href=\"Sami\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Sami</a> lägger han Wish på oss tre för att vi ska bli av med cursen och det fungerar, vi är fria. Vi funderar på att hjälpa <a data-href=\"The Wizard\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The Wizard</a> med the Simulacrum och så länge drar vi till <a data-href=\"Mahmoud’s Mystic Arcanum\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/04_places/shrivell's-reach/mahmoud’s-mystic-arcanum.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mahmoud’s Mystic Arcanum</a> och säljer lite pryttlar och köper bl.a. manteln till Hilmia som hon suktat efter. Även en chestplate till Tony köps in. När vi pratar med <a data-href=\"Mahmoud\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mahmoud</a> kommer vi på att vi faktiskt skulle få en Ki-essence av honom, som nu är klar och vi får den. Cory är sugen på något/några items men klarar inte att ta beslutet för att köpa. Jag drar sen till <a data-href=\"Ahmed\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ahmed</a> och köper en Wand of Jump för 1 Soul Coin och ger till Cory så han kan bli av med sin ring. Vi ångrar oss sedan kring <a data-href=\"The Wizard\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The Wizard</a>s uppdrag och träffar honom en snabbis innan vi går till kajen där skepp mot ytan går. När vi ska lägga oss får jag mha Bagge besöka <a data-href=\"Stora G\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Stora G</a> och får en kort dialog med han <a data-href=\"#Meeting with Stora G\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/#Meeting with Stora G\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Meeting with Stora G</a>\nlong resten i slutet av föra sessionen har inte skett ännu\nEn rödhyad, brunhårig tiefling dam är den enda som tittar emot oss, hon går ner från sitt skepp och möter oss. Med armarna i kors ställer hon sig och kollar emot oss. \"Aha...?\" säger hon frågandes.<br>Vi frågar om hon vet om ön med spöket är och om hon kan ta oss dit först och sen vidare, men det verkar hon inte känna till. Men efter lite diskussion kan hon lösa det ändå, men det blir en halv-dags resa kortare för oss i öknen. Hon behöver bara lite guidning av oss. Hon heter <a data-href=\"Rath\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Rath</a>Skeppet har tre våningar, där rodret är, huvud-däck och sen lägre däck. <br>Vi kommer till en ö som vi tror är rätt. Den är fylld av dimma. Vi landar och blir avsläppta och prompt därefter drar <a data-href=\"Rath\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Rath</a> iväg utanför dimman med skeppet.\nMan ser typ ingenting. Det ser ut som att saker rör på sig i dimman. Men en av oss som såg bra kunde få ut att det nog inte är något utan bara synvilla.\nHilmia tar av alla täckande kläder, så alla \"odöda\"/spöklika delar syns. Vi går en bit fram men det känns inte som vi kommer närmare.Hilmia pratar ut i dimman och säger att vi bara vill prata. Vi får inget svar direkt. Hilmia tycker att det känns lite som att vi är på en kyrkogård. Vi går en bit och känner oss mer och mer övervakade, spionerade på.\nTony får ett ryck och frågar om han får läsa från vart av våra blod. Han läser Hilmia och mitt.<br>\nVi går vidare och Hilmia börjar ropa igen och säga att vi inte vill något illa och att Hilmia är från <a data-href=\"Ranhold\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ranhold</a> och att hon dött o uppstått minst en gång. Cory och Hilmia ser någon rödhårig figur hukad på hustaket framför oss. Men efter att dimman sveper förbi är figuren borta.\nFiguren svarar Hilmia. \"Jag känner igen platsen ni pratar om. Varför är ni här?\"\nHilmia svarar men figuren litar inte på oss. De pratar lite till och Hilmia försöker övertala figuren. Efter en kort stund hör vi nåt metalliskt släpande mot kullerstenen och snabbt kommer en värja fram som stannar precis innan den spetsar Hilmias hals. En hand kommer fram och tar tag i Hilmias hand. Kort efter släpper den taget och försvinner i dimman. Skuggorna skingrar sig och vi ser hela figuren. Det pulserar något blått i hennes bröstkorg som gör att man kan se allt skelett där i. Hon vill prata mer med Hilmia, men vill inte att vi hänger med. Så vi tre stannar bakom medan de två går iväg in i huset.<br>De pratar lite i huset. Hon kommer ihåg <a data-href=\"Ranhold\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ranhold</a> och vem som dödade henne. Hon har två gånger själv dödat personen som hon blev mördad av, men varje gång återuppstår han. Han bär en tigers ansikte tydligen, med blå kläder, kan det vara <a data-href=\"Aksayakumara\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/aksayakumara.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Aksayakumara</a> eller <a data-href=\"Al-Riyada\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/al-riyada.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Al-Riyada</a> kanske?\nHon berättar att hon gjorde en deal med denna tidigare nämnda personen och efter dealen var gjord blev hon dödad, men hon dog aldrig på riktigt.\nEfter en stund säger damen att Hilmia borde gå, och drar sig längre in i huset. Skuggor överallt börjar röra sig emot Hilmia. Väl ute fortsätter skuggorna efter Hilmia och efter oss när vi går mot bryggan. Jag skjuter några Blasts för att signalera skeppet. Jag ser att de returnerar ett signalement också och de verkar vara på väg. Men det kommer ta ett litet tag. Vi behöver hålla vår position oss en stund först..Skuggorna rör sig närmare och vi hör tydligare och högre ljud, viskningar och till slut rena rop på hjälp ur skuggorna. 4 skuggor kommer upp ur marken, går mot och börjar attackera oss.Hilmia Cory\n2x Skuggor\nSingwin Tony\n2x Skuggor\nMina Eldritch Blasts verkar göra bra nytta på dem med sin Force Damage.En bit in i fighten försvinner nästan alla skuggorna, och vi börjar höra knakande och ser sprickor som börjar komma. Hilmia blir björn i fighten men faller ur shapeshiften och blir björn igen, men faller ur igen och downar. Jag ger Cory Potion of Fire Giant Strength som han matar Hilmia med under fighten också.\nBåten har precis kommit intill och så jag springer fram till downade Hilmia (med 2 death saves) och Thunderstep:ar till båten.\nDe andra tar sig upp på båten snart och under tiden stabiliserar jag Hilmia med Spare the Dying. (Filip rollar som tur är success på sin Death Save innan jag hinner stabilisera)<br>Vi alla mår skit och är skadade. <a data-href=\"Rath\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Rath</a> kommer fram till oss och frågar lite.<br>\n\"Hoppas att ni fann vad ni sökte efter...\" säger <a data-href=\"Rath\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Rath</a>.<br>Skeppet börjar röra sig bortåt men inte snabbt nog innan dimman tränger sig in över båten. Vi kommer iväg en bit och <a data-href=\"Rath\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Rath</a> böjer sig ned till Hilmia o frågar om detta verkligen kunde vara värt besväret. Hilmia säger att hon fick lite svar som är viktiga.<br><a data-href=\"Rath\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Rath</a> säger att hon kan landa oss på en av de större vägarna som är rakt västerut från <a data-href=\"Mar-Dekesh\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/04_places/shrivell's-reach/mar-dekesh.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mar-Dekesh</a>, så vi kan bara följa vägen österut för att komma dit efter vi landat.Det är ett fint skepp som är väldigt hemtrevligt. Vi leds till våra hytter som det finns 12 stycken av, och i slutet av korridoren finns även kaptenshytten. Sängarna är breda och mjuka, med fina lakan och samtliga hytter har oxå fönster ut.<br>Vi alla sover hela natten och får en long rest. Nu händer även den solo-delen jag hade med Jacob förra sessionen <a data-href=\"Session 44 - 2024-02-04#Meeting with Stora G\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-44-2024-02-04.html#Meeting with Stora G\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Session 44 - 2024-02-04 &gt; Meeting with Stora G</a><br>\nJag ändrar min <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Character Sheet > Eldritch Invocations\" data-href=\"Character Sheet#Eldritch Invocations\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/01_pcs/singwin-mistwalker-folder/character-sheet.html#Eldritch Invocations\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Astral Infuser</a> till Enhanced Defence till Cory. Jag attune:ar om lite också. Jag o-attune:ar Eaglereign och attune:ar <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Items.canvas\" data-href=\"Items.canvas\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/01_pcs/singwin-mistwalker-folder/while-playing/items.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Illusionist's Bracer</a> istället.\nDet är typ ett dygn kvar på resan.Vi diskuterar lite mellan oss kring hur det gick för Hilmia igår i huset.\nCory upptäcker under frukosten mina nya bracers och frågar lite om dem. Sen berättar jag lite halvdiffust kring bracersarna för de andra. Men inte konkret.<br>\nVi går omkring lite på skeppet sen och kapten <a data-href=\"Rath\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Rath</a> möter oss och säger att vi är förföljda sen igår. Vi har lyckats hålla avstånd från dem men de följer oss fortfarande. Antagligen av en stark magiker då de rörde sig på ett sätt bara de kan åstadkomma. Hon funderar på om vi kanske hade fiender som är så sura på oss att de vill följa efter på detta sätt. Vi funderar på om det kan vara <a data-href=\"Zarah\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Zarah</a> eller om det kan va nån av Rakshazarna vi känt sen tidigare. <a data-href=\"Rath\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Rath</a> säger att om det är <a data-href=\"Zarah\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Zarah</a> och hon kommer ifatt så tänker hon lämna över oss, hon vill inte stå i skuld till henne.<br>Vi diskuterar lite och jag nämner möjligheten att ta fram den stora örnen och flyga iväg med den om det skulle behövas. Den kan då få en Potion of Growth och nån av oss en Potion of Diminution så orkar den nog bära oss alla. Men då behöver jag attune:a om. Ifall det är intressant, så gör jag det nu, spenderar en timme på att byta attunement från <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Items.canvas\" data-href=\"Items.canvas\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/01_pcs/singwin-mistwalker-folder/while-playing/items.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Gauntlets of Eldritch Ferocity</a> till Eaglereign igen.Efter ett tag börjar några golems de har här att falla ihop till grushögar. Hilmia ser när en av dem gör detta och hon springer upp för att berätta för kaptenen.\nJag ståendes uppe vid rodret märker tydligt att något har hänt. Jag och kaptenen som står jämte går framför rodret och ser ner. Där ser vi Hilmia med en blodfläck under henne, men inget annat runtomkring. Sen förvandlar hon sig till tiger och börjar svepa i luften. Jag märker att hon träffar något metalliskt i svepet, som är helt osynligt.<br>\nAnvänder Blink för att försöka ta mig till Ethereal Plane o se det osynliga. Berättar för <a data-href=\"Rath\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Rath</a> att det är något osynligt som Hilmia som nu är tiger har slagit på. <a data-href=\"Rath\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Rath</a> tar fram mängder av knivar ur sina kläder, redo att kastas.Jag readyar Hold Person till att om jag ser någon i Ethereal Plane så använder jag den. Blink lyckas och jag försvinner in i Ethereal Plane och ser direkt, en rakshaza med svart päls, en porslinsmask, en curved sabel och en sköld. Jag försöker med Hold Person, dock är han fel creature-type, men utöver det känns det inte som att spellen når fram, den stannar strax innan. Han har kanske nån form av magisk sköld?Vi försöker attackera men det är svårt på en osynlig. Jag lyckas träffa en av mina blasts på mitt osynliga target. De andra försöker attackera, men lyckas inte så bra. Tills Tony med Snowflake försöker igen, denna gången träffar han tydligt i armen på den, och en del av den blir synlig igen.\n\"Aaaarghhh, there she is! I've been looking for you for a long time!\" säger rakshazan, antagligen angående svärdet.\nHan försöker slänga Dominate Person på vad som visade sig vara Hilmia, men jag lyckas med Counterspell.Lite mer fight. Hilmia summonar 8 vargar som alla attackerar och gör en hel del skada. Då magi funkar dåligt slänger jag inte Eldritch Blast utan rechargear en spellslot med Rod of the Pact Keeper. Han försöker strax efter med Fly på sig själv (level 7) och jag failar counterspell på den och är nu slut på spell slots igen.Det visar sig sen att den som flög iväg bara var en illusion. Den riktiga stod kvar på däcket. Vi försöker ett tag till att få tag i honom men han är för snabb. Han Misty Steppar och dashar omkring konstant och vi kommer inte ifatt, inte ens när jag är Blinkad lyckas vi.\"It has been a very long time since I had such a pleasant fight. But I have done what I came here to do. That is, see you fight hahahahhah. We shall meet again soon.\" säger han och alla golems vaknar till liv och tar upp sina vapen. Sen försvinner han och jag känner att han slänger Plane Shift och försvinner.<br>\nAlla han har använt sin Claw attack på, vilket är alla oss 4, vilket ger oss en curse, igen. Denna gör att vi får inget av att ta Short eller Longrests. Alls. Jag upptäcker även i slutet här att <a data-href=\"Rath\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Rath</a> är helt borta. Har inte sett till henne sen fighten började.

Hittar kaptenen och löser dilemmat som är där. Pga att Golemsarna var hennes crew, så kan hon inte längre flyga skeppet ordentligt. Vi tackar och beklagar för att det blivit problem. Vi sa att vi om vi hade haft fler Soul Coins hade hon fått dem som ersättning. Hon tackar för detta. Vi använder min stora örn till att flyga ner till marken så hon slipper landa. Vi landar i sanden och jag ropar efter Irago och sen efter Magazeem. När jag ropat efter den sistnämnde säger Irago bakom mig ”Han hör dig inte”.

Avslutningsvis får vi alla gå upp i level 8.\n![[]]Vi fattar mod igen efter vi insett vad som hänt med den stora svarta katten vi slogs mot tidigare. Vi ser ett par av de golems som fanns på skeppet och de börjar bli hotfulla.\nVi börjar fight mot dem, tre golemsDe verkar ta mycket skada från Force damage, men inte så mycket från vanlig physical damage. Jag summonar mini-griffon och ber han leta upp kaptenen. Till slut när han letat ett tag säger han med telekinesis att det låter något från aktern på nedervåningen. <br>Vi lyckas oskadliggöra dem och jag med hjälp av Tony harvestar lite olja från en av dem. Jag berättar för de andra att det låter något från ett rum i aktern. Hilmia och Cory börjar röra sig ditåt. De hittar att kaptenen står där i ett rum med nån form av järnflaska i handen och i rummet finns det som ett vind-element som skapar som en tornado i rummet. Det går knappt att gå där inne. Cory lyckas ta sig fram och stoppa in en Sending Stone så hon har den i sin ägo, och sen skickar de ett meddelande ”Vad kan vi göra?!” och de får svar direkt från <a data-href=\"Rath\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Rath</a>; ”Tänd eldar!”.<br>\nDe försöker mha magi tända braziers och torches men lyckas bara hålla igång en torch Cory har.

Stora svarta kissen släppte tydligen ut den innan han kom upp och attackerade oss.

Jag blir jätterädd. Vi pratar lite och han berättar att vi inte kommer överleva natten som det ser ut nu, inte utan honom. Jag ber han därför att stanna med oss. Han räcker ut handen och ber oss ta i den. Vi gör det, och han tar med oss till <a data-href=\"Saxicus Saloon\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Saxicus Saloon</a>, dit vi kom när vi kom hit till <a data-href=\"Shrivell’s Reach\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/99_maps/shrivell’s-reach.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Shrivell’s Reach</a> för ett bra tag sen.<br>\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Saxicus\" data-href=\"Saxicus\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/saxicus.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Irago</a> berättar att vi om vi sticker från <a data-href=\"Shrivell’s Reach\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/99_maps/shrivell’s-reach.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Shrivell’s Reach</a> innan natten så kommer han inte kunna spåra oss längre.

Sen chantar han någonting och lägger Remove Curse på var och en av oss. Och vi alla blir fria.

Vi går ut och där är det mängder med folk. Vi går direkt till <a data-href=\"Harry\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Harry</a> i baren. Det har gått bra sen sist, inget superspännande har hänt, allt har fungerat. Kriget är fortfarande igång, fronten har förflyttats en bit uppåt. <br>Hilmia går till ett bord till någon hon hjälpt tidigare med hans vapen, som verkar ha gått sönder. <a data-href=\"Tuatana\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Tuatana</a> heter han. Hilmia hämtar mig så jag får kolla på den och ser ganska snabbt att den inte går att laga. Man behöver göra om allt förutom själva bladet. Han tackar för informationen. Berättar att han sak iväg i övermorgon på jobb och tills dess behöver han ha ett vapen. Jag säger att jag kanske kan hjälpa till och han lyser upp lite och han frågar bara vad jag vill ha för det. Säger att jag får fundera lite och han får ge mig nån timme så jag vet vad som krävs och om jag hinner lösa. Han tackar. <br>Tony går till Harry och berättar, visar och provsmakar vinet vi tog från <a data-href=\"Aksayakumara\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/aksayakumara.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Aksayakumara</a>. Han tyckte det var spännande att det var från <a data-href=\"Maraja\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/04_places/shrivell's-reach/maraja.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Maraja</a> och säger att Tony kan få sälja till honom när han fått igång sin vingård.Vi alla är väldigt trötta och funderar på att lägga oss. men jag vill kolla lite på hur man kan lösa yxan innan jag lägger mig. Jag går och får låna den över natten. Identifierar det lite speciella materialet innan jag somnar också. Det är XX, hjälper att fokusera ilska (Rage). Kommer på ett par olika idéer man kan göra med yxan. En är att försöka göra likadan som innan, men det är nog svårt och det känns inte bra för mig. utan jag gör hellre något eget. Och då kan jag kanske göra om den till en handyxa, hatchet, då bladet ändå inte är tillräckligt stort för att vara en tvåhandad yxa.<br>\nFår en bit silverek (35GP på min tab) av <a data-href=\"Harry\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Harry</a> på morgonen efter vi sovit så arbetar jag sedan resten av dagen med detta.3 Checks\n1d20 + Wisdom + Blacksmith prof (if prof) - 6 + 2 (Wis) + 3 (prof)\n1d20 + Strength + Blacksmith prof (if prof) - 17 + 0 (Str) + 3 (prof)\n1d20 + Strength + Blacksmith prof (if prof) - 11 + 0 (str) + 3 (prof)\nFick ett steg ovanför en normal clear för crafting.\n<br>Väl klar så träffar jag Hilmia och vi går tillsammans och möter <a data-href=\"Tuatana\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Tuatana</a>. Jag ger fram yxan och han känner lite på den. Det är inte som han förväntade sig och han vet inte om han tycker om att kasta yxan. Försöker övertala han om att han kan kasta den från ena handen och ha en melee-version i andra handen. Han tycker det låter ganska vettigt.<br>\nHan går sedan till <a data-href=\"Harry\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Harry</a> och lägger fram typ 12 Platinum.

Han säger också att det bara är för tanken att vi gjorde det, det ska komma en riktig betalning för arbetet också.<br>Vi sitter till slut på kvällen alla fyra och bara chillar och slappnar av för en gångs skull.

Sen har vi en ledig kväll. Vi sitter tillsammans o snackar strunt bara ett tag innan vi går o kollar till om Gideon har kommit tillbaks. Vi går in o snackar lite. Tony tar upp frågan om böckerna vi stal från <a data-href=\"Zarah\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Zarah</a>. Om inte Tony vill ha den så kan han bara sälja den eller nåt, men bör vara lite varsam om till vem eller vart man säljer den.\nSen berättar Hilmia om den curseade boken vi gav till devilen. Han tror inte att vi kan göra något åt det nu, men tackar för informationen.<br>Jag nämner också att jag lämnade iväg min bok till Stora G, Gideon tycker det var nobelt och antar att jag har fått en vettig återbetalning för detta.

Vi får berättat för oss att vi kanske aldrig kommer kunna åka på havet igen pga. Tonys ursprung och hans vattenorms-gud som är sugen på honom och även oss om vi färdas med han. Han berättar att vi har ett mission vi behöver göra för att återbetala vår teleportation circle-åtkomst. Drottningen har beställt ett uppdrag från oss. Vi ska förkläs till orcher och infiltrera dem. Det uppdraget kommer börja om 6 dagar eller 7 om vi vill ha ledigt en till dag. Sen går ja ut till Harry o frågar om jag kan få en större smedja i mitt rum, vilket verkar va lite problematiskt. Men fixar iaf alla material som behövs för att fixa handen till Tony.Dagen efter drar Hilmia och Tony tillbaks till vingården och försöker hitta på en bra lösning så de kommer igång snabbt med det. Jag craftar Tonys protesSteelsinger\nHookshot (30ft), Launch (1d6, 30ft)Hookshot (X ft.). This enhancement consists of a metallic hook or similar tool attached to a spool of chain, rope, or wire. The number in parentheses is the range of the hookshot. If the prosthesis isn’t being used to hold an item, you can shoot the hook at a fixed surface within range as a bonus action, or as a reaction when falling. The hook then attaches to that surface until you use a bonus action to detach the hook and reel the rope back in, or until the rope is destroyed. The rope is an object with AC 10 and 10 hit points.\nAlternatively, you can fire the hook at another creature at least two sizes larger than you, making an attack roll with the prosthesis. You’re considered proficient with the attack, which uses your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack roll. On a hit, it deals no damage, but the hook attaches to the target. A creature within 5 feet of the hook can use an action to forcefully detach the hook with a successful DC 10 Strength or Dexterity check.\nWhile the hook is attached, you have advantage on ability checks made to move along the rope, such as to climb a vertical surface, swim against a current, or walk against a strong wind, and you can’t move or be moved more than the hookshot’s range away from the point to which the hook is attached . If you’re falling, you stop falling further than the range at which you shot the hookshot and become suspended from the surface the hook is attached to. In addition, until the hook is reeled back in, the prosthesis can’t hold anything or be used to make attacks, and you can’t use or benefit from objects integrated into the prosthesis (such as attacking with a weapon or benefitting from a shield’s bonus to AC).Launch (XdX, X ft.). A portion of this prosthesis is attached to the limb by a length of chain, rope, or wire, and can be launched at an enemy. If the prosthesis has the Hookshot property, the hook is the same piece that gets launched as a weapon. If the prosthesis has an integrated weapon with the Thrown property, the weapon can be the projectile that is launched at the enemy, but the damage of the Launch property doesn’t change. The prosthesis is a ranged weapon that uses your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. If you’re proficient with a weapon that has the Thrown property, you’re considered proficient with this weapon . The portion of the prosthesis used to attack is automatically reeled in immediately after . The information in parentheses notes the attack’s damage dice, damage type, and range, respectively .rolla 28, DC17.\n2 Quirks Durable (triple hp of item)\nArtisanal craftsmanship (+1 till damage) rolla 10+11=21, DC15\n1 Quirk Self-Preservation System ","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#session"],"headers":[{"heading":"Current agenda","level":2,"id":"Current_agenda_0"},{"heading":"Goals","level":7,"id":"Goals_0"},{"heading":"Session Summary","level":2,"id":"Session_Summary_0"},{"heading":"Recap of last session","level":2,"id":"Recap_of_last_session_0"},{"heading":"Log","level":2,"id":"Log_0"},{"heading":"<em>Unlocks till level 8</em>","level":3,"id":"*Unlocks_till_level_8*_0"},{"heading":"Log","level":3,"id":"Log_1"},{"heading":"Crafting","level":3,"id":"Crafting_0"},{"heading":"Hookshot","level":5,"id":"Hookshot_0"},{"heading":"Launch","level":5,"id":"Launch_0"},{"heading":"Manufacturing","level":4,"id":"Manufacturing_0"},{"heading":"Enchanting","level":4,"id":"Enchanting_0"}],"links":[".html","03_npcs/saxicus.html","04_places/shrivell's-reach/shrivell's-reach.html","04_places/helm's-bearing/helm’s-bearing.html",".html",".html","01_pcs/singwin-mistwalker-folder/character-sheet.html#Eldritch Invocations",".html","03_npcs/robius.html",".html",".html","03_npcs/robius.html",".html",".html",".html","01_pcs/singwin-mistwalker-folder/while-playing/items.html"],"author":"Rasmus","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-47-2024-03-23.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":["05_quests/current-goals-singwin-mistforger.md","02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-46-2024-03-02.html"],"createdTime":1730964968406,"modifiedTime":1750785651695,"sourceSize":6283,"sourcePath":"02_Journal/Thalbrine - Big campaign/Session 47 - 2024-03-23.md","exportPath":"02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-47-2024-03-23.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":226,"backlinks":["02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-48-2024-08-23-starting-the-orc-infiltration-arc.html"],"type":"markdown"},"02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-48-2024-08-23-starting-the-orc-infiltration-arc.html":{"title":"Session 48 - 2024-08-23 - Starting the Orc-infiltration arc","icon":"","description":"\nHitta ett sätt att få hem Holger\nFixa ett material med ursprung från the Astral Plane\nHälsa på Semil Wildmagic i Bastion Shore\nKomma på ett namn på byn där Cecil och Arvid finns Tony har stuckit till Bastion Shore för att hitta arbetare som kan hjälpa honom att restaurera hans mansion.

Han frågar vad vi vet och vi berättar att vi inte vet ett jota, förutom att vi ska typ infiltrera orcherna utklädda som dem.Han ska berätta hur allt ligger till och efter det går vi ner till armoryt och ska få rustningar där som förklär oss till orcher, samt amuletter som hjälper oss att förstå och tala orchiska. ”Ni ska påstå er vara ett rövarband. Ni ska komma från bergslagen österifrån. Ni ska vara utan klantillhörighet. Vi tillhör föredetta blodklanen Xuul. En utdöd klan som vi måste ha lämnat för över 2 decennier sedan.”\nFörklädnaderna kommer spegla vår ålder som orcher. Om vi är gamla nu så kommer vi se gamla ut som orcher.Vi ska få ett emblem. Det ser ut som en orch-hand som håller runt bladet på en kniv, samt att blod rinner ner från den. Det är en symbol för Åderlåtning. ”Ni tillber Luthik, en ganska bortglömd Demigud bland orchernas pantheon.” Det görs generellt genom blotning, levande offer.\nNi kan använda magi, men var varsamma om vilken. Klanen vi ska härstamma ifrån använde bara blodmagi. Om vi ska använda annat än den typen av magi så behöver det se ut som blodmagi. Om ni slänger en spell, spill blod när ni gör det.-Om vi vill låtsas slänga en blodspell så kan vi göra det genom att ta en 1d6 damage samt ha något vasst nära till hands-När vi får första kontakt kommer vi onekligen bli testade. Men säg att vi är här för att slå samman krigsinsatserna. Att vi vill gå med orcherna i deras insats.\nVi har hört talas om en hobgoblin som vi har hopp om och som vi har börjat respektera, befälhavare Vesuvius.Ni är inte där för att orsaka våld. Befälhavare Vesuvius är en hobgoblin, en utbildad strateg som förstår sig på våra sätt att strida. Vi ska försöka på ungefär en vecka (så länge vår förklädnad håller) komma så nära honom vi bara kan. Vi behöver sno två saker, hans närmsta krigsplaner för de närmsta månaderna, och kopierar eller stjäl kommunikations brev de skickar mellan orch-banden.\nEtt tredje uppdrag är att sabotera kedjeballistan. Om vi lyckas med det så kommer de bli oerhört tacksamma och betala oss väl. Behöver inte förstöra den men åtminstone sabotera tillfälligt så att det tar tid för den att komma igång igen. Vi går ner och får tag i våra rustningar.\nGällande armors, vi får välja en av;\nHeavy Armor AC17, disadvantage stealth\nMedium Armor AC14, Scale\nLight Armor AC12\nJag tar ett Light Armor och får 14 AC totalt. Jag tar av mig Gauntlets of Eldritch Ferocity för att istället ta amuletten.\nVäskan kan funka rätt bra när man vart rövare ett tag. Jag har helt enkelt hittat den nånstans under åren och det är min väska och mordhotar vem än som vill ta den från mig.Vi tar på oss amuletterna strax efter rustningarna och vi upptäcker snabbt att vi endast kan prata orcish när vi har på dem, men dessutom förstår vi INGET ANNAT språk än orcish.Vi börjar gå utåt och blir eskorterade iväg till ett annat torn än vi var vid tidigare. Där uppe finns 4 wyverns fastkedjade tillsammans med 4 väldigt lugna filurer som verkar kanske vara ryttarna. De säger att vi ska åka på natten så vi får chilla ett tag.\nCory frågar oss andra kring namn, vi har ju inga namn.\nVi försöker komma på lite och har;\nSingwin - Azog\nCory - Zaard\nHilmia - Zulla\nTony - BagamulNär tiden är inne så får vi skjuts av ryttarna på de 4 wyverns som fanns där. Vi kommer en lång bit under natten. Vi släpps av i skogen strax österut om dit vi ska.\nRyttarna säger; ”Ni bör sätta av i den riktningen. Mot Lord Draedon’s gamla camp. om det blir dag innan ni är framme så får ni vila. Möt dem endast under natten, annars kommer det vara för suspekt.”Vi sätter av och ryttarna med sina wyverns lämnar oss.\nVi försöker oxå memorera hur varandra ser ut. Det är inte så många delar längre som får oss att bli igenkända av varandra. Tonys arm och svärd, Hilmias ålder och mantel, Corys spjut och min väska. Vi behöver hålla bra koll på varandra.Vi kommer inte särskilt långt innan det blir soligt och vi börjar slå camp.\nVi chillar under dagen och sen när det blir natt fortsätter vi gå och försöker hitta framåt.\nEfter ett tag känns det som att vi är iakttagna men vi är för sega, de överraskar oss och vi blir omringade.\nEn större orc av dem kommer fram och inspekterar o luktar på oss.\n”Lammkött!” ropar han.\nVi svarar att vi är här för att joina krigsefforten.\nHan svarar att ”Vi har tillräckligt med krigare, OCH förrädare!”\n”Vem av er är starkast???!” säger han medan han tar fram sin stora stridsyxa.<br>\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Tony Waru\" data-href=\"Tony Waru\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/01_pcs/not-my-pcs/tony-waru.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Tony</a>, eller Bagamul, drar sitt svärd direkt. Dock är det inte lika stort som när han bär det som människa, det ser väldigt litet ut och den stora orcen börjar skratta i respons medan han pekar på det lilla svärdet och sen mot sin stora stridsyxa.Tony vinner fighten. Vi pratar lite mer med honom och vi lyckas övertala så vi får följa med till campen. Han ropar fram Kork och Mork, som verkar vara kanske tvillingar? De är väldigt lika. Vi fick ta deras sängplatser, men de tyckte inte helt om det. De fick sedan eskortera oss till campet.\nVi pratar lite med Mork och Kork på vägen. Vi får veta att de har samma mor, och hon har totalt 29 barn.Vi närmar oss. Vi börjar höra trummor och kommer igenom ett stängsel av trä. Vi leds till en liten samling med tält. Ser ut att vara i lite sämre skick och ligger lite trängre än de andra. Detta är små en-persons tält.ByeaDet sitter ett stort antal runt en eld. En av dem ställer sig upp och kommer fram till oss. Han hejar på Kork o Mork. De säger att vi ska sova i deras tält. Den stora säger att vi är 4 och inte får plats. De två fattar inte helt men vi får till slut två tält till från Eork och Öork.Hilmia/Zulla får sitt tält och går o stannar där. Vi andra tre fastnade runt brasan och får halvgrillat tilldelat oss, men vi är lite kluvna på om vi kan få ner det.Några har lite frågor till oss. Först till Tony om varför han har ett så litet svärd. Sen Singwin om jag oxå använder svärd. Jag väljer att skära mig lite i handen och skjuta en enda blast i marken och det väckte stort intresse. De blev rätt tveksamma då det inte finns så många såna. O till sist Cory om vad för släktskap vi har.\nOxå vart lite frågor kring vår ålder, vart vi kommer ifrån o lite så.\nVi får höra att Vesuvius ska snacka under kvällen, vi ska bara vänta på att hornen ljudar. Och det gör dem efter ett tag. Alla går iväg och vi hänger med.\nVi kommer fram och märker att det är oerhört mycket folk. Det är dessutom inte bara orcher. Det är oxå goblins och hobgoblins, alla med full plate och de verkar dessutom oxå ha en något högre rang. En flintskallig hobgoblin som är helt röd i huden går fram till en plattform. Har varken armor eller vapen på sig. Endast ett gäng krigsmålningar över kroppen. När han står där uppe tittar han verkligen ner över folkmassan.”Mitt blod och min familj. Vi samlas denna kväll ännu en gång. En dag, en grying. En måne närmare våran frihet. Jag säger till er gång på gång, vecka efter vecka. Sanrt är den här. Vi ska inte leva längre under förtryck, under rädsla, under den lilla mat som vi måste dela tillsammans, byea. Åh nej. Det här landet ska tillhöra oss som det gjorde en gång. Vi ska aldrig kunna oroa oss över att vi ska kunna öka våra klaner, mata våra barn. Alla finns det plats för. Här, i den fjärde härden, så har vi gjort mer framgång, framsteg, mer.. för oss. För hela den orchiska och goblinoida rasen. Det finns ingen grupp som har tagit så mycket som vi, tillbaks till oss. Landet är vårat. För länge sedan var det det. Och det är det nu med, bestulet! Men kom med månadens slut, en sann, en sann rättvisa återförs. Höj era blad! Höj dem! Om ni vill befria orchen en gång! Höj era vapen, låt det höras, den starkaste rasen utav alla!!\nHan sträcker fram sin hand in mot den stora brasan in i elden och drar ut ett blad ur tomma luften gjort av ren eld. Det är uppenbart nu att han besitter magiska krafter. Han höjer eldsvärdet högt och han verkar inte bry sig alls att det brinner i handen på honom. Allas vapen slår upp i en flamma, alla som står och lyssnar med sina vapen uppe.\nDet är en sann enighet, alla har ett gemensamt mål. Vi kan känna deras vilja, nästan så man kan ta på den. Det chantas o ropas i 10 minuter typ o sen höjer han sin hand igen för att tysta alla. Sen fortsätter han prata; ”Vi är snart där, om tre dagar ska vi iväg igen för att slåss och då lämnar vi detta campet bakom oss. Vår största strid ännu. Målet är nära” typ.\nSen börjar alla gå ifrån och vi får en möjlighet att kunna gå åt vilket håll vi vill.<br>\nHilmia lyckades ta en bra titt på <a data-href=\"Vesuvius\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Vesuvius</a> under talet.Vi går en bit efter honom, åt samma håll som han gick. Vi försöker hitta vart han tog vägen. Dock till slut möts vi av en hobgoblin. Han stoppar oss och frågar vad vi gör här. Vi säger att vi utforskar campet, då vi är nya. Han tar tag i Hilmia o kollar hennes högra öra o säger ”Ni är inte märkta. Nya rekryter?” Vi svarar ja. Han frågar om vi har sovplatser, vi svarar nej. Han pekar att vi ska gå till det tredje vakttornet åt ett visst håll och vi vänder och går ditåt.\nPå vägen efter en stund upptäcker vi spår av tassar. Det är inte riktigt Wargs, deras spår ser lite annorlunda ut. De ser inte riktigt lika aggressiva ut. Det kan kanske vara någon domestikerad hund typ. Spåren leder ut i gräset, bort från alla tält och allt ljus. Vi fortsätter gå. Går förbi en Warg pit på vägen som verkar hanteras av enbart Goblins.Väl framme möts vi av en äldre kvinna med benknotor i håret och långa äckliga naglar. Hon grejar med en okänd substans och mortlar olika örter. Hon ristar substansen in nåt märke på högersidan av halsen på alla som står o väntar. Det luktar rätt illa och det känns nästan som urin. Kvinnan ställer en hel del frågor om oss och vårt ursprung. Men vi har lite svårt att svara på alla frågor. Känns som hon blir lite osäker. Men hon går över till att hon beklagar att vi har förlorat vår moder och hon kanske kan hjälpa oss o sen tar hon Hilmia/Zulla in i tältet och de försvinner. Tony läser av blodet som var i en av skålarna och känner att det tillhör en medelålders orch som är cursed med lycantrophy, en wereboar. Om man beblandar sitt blod med detta så kommer cursen spridas till en själv.Hilmia/Zulla får del av ett brinnande pulver som hon ska andas in för att minnas.\n”Hilmia du måste vidare. Något fruktansvärt är på väg. Du känner det, likväl jag”En halvalv, rynkig och gråhårig, din lärare. ”Du måste bort, fly Hilmia. Du måste bort, nu!”Hon leds ut och möter oss. Lite kort snack sen frågar Hilmia om hon kan få lägga sig ner nånstans. Vi leds allihop till ett tält en bit bort som tillhör Lagroshka, som inte är på plats förrän om tre dagar när vi drar.\nTanten säger att vi andra tre ändå måste märkas och vi hänger på. Vi är lite osäkra men det får gå. Nån minut efter att vi har märkts, börjar vi höra ylanden, skrattande ylanden. Låter som hyenor. Vi hör klingor och vi ser lågor. Vi märker en ensam Gnoll som sprintar emot oss. Han blir t-bonad av en annan orch. Vi märker att nåt är lurigt. Gnolls hör inte hemma tillsammans med orcherna. Och varför sprang den emot oss?","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#session"],"headers":[{"heading":"Current agenda","level":2,"id":"Current_agenda_0"},{"heading":"Goals","level":7,"id":"Goals_0"},{"heading":"Session Summary","level":2,"id":"Session_Summary_0"},{"heading":"Recap of last session","level":2,"id":"Recap_of_last_session_0"},{"heading":"Session Summary","level":8,"id":"Session_Summary_1"},{"heading":"Log","level":2,"id":"Log_0"}],"links":["?query=tag:craftingquest1",".html","01_pcs/not-my-pcs/tony-waru.html",".html"],"author":"Rasmus","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-48-2024-08-23-starting-the-orc-infiltration-arc.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":["05_quests/current-goals-singwin-mistforger.md"],"createdTime":1750181112566,"modifiedTime":1749397848027,"sourceSize":14399,"sourcePath":"02_Journal/Thalbrine - Big campaign/Session 48 - 2024-08-23 - Starting the Orc-infiltration arc.md","exportPath":"02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-48-2024-08-23-starting-the-orc-infiltration-arc.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":227,"backlinks":["02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-49-2025-06-08.html"],"type":"markdown"},"02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-49-2025-06-08.html":{"title":"Session 49 - 2025-06-08","icon":"","description":"\nHitta ett sätt att få hem Holger\nFixa ett material med ursprung från the Astral Plane\nHälsa på Semil Wildmagic i Bastion Shore\nKomma på ett namn på byn där Cecil och Arvid finns Allra först undersökte vi framtidsplaner och planerade ett gäng speltillfällen under sommaren direkt.\nVi fick en stoooor genomgång först av vad som hänt hittills.\nSen drar vi igång och påbörjar där vi slutade sist. Saker har börjat brinna och vi har hört lite konstiga ljud. Vi är ute efter att hitta war-plans och förstöra ballistan.Vi funderar lite på vad vi ska hitta på först. Men innan vi hinner ta beslut hör Hilmia/Zulla någon som bakom palisaden vi står vid går omkring och pratar lite. Cory hör också någon som går i slasket där bakom. Han hoppar upp och kollar på andra sidan och ser någon stor konstig filur som verkar gå mot vår del av campet. Det finns bara en väg ut härifrån. Vi gömmer oss i närmsta tält.Han kommer in i området och vi försöker hålla oss tysta. Han går långsamt och sniffar lite. Till slut tänder han en fackla och vi ser att ett tält nu brinner. Medan han tittar bort så smyger vi ut med Pass Without Trace av Hilmia. Vi går ut och går mot elden. Vi går förbi en till likadan filur som inte verkar se oss. Jag använder Locate Object och söker efter papper eller pergament för att nå War-plansen. Jag känner att det är direkt på andra sidan av palisaden vi står vid här. Cory hoppar upp och ser att det är en sån gris-filur som har pergamentrulle i bältet. Vi tror att det kanske inte är.\nVi går vidare lite. Jag skickar upp min griffon som hittar två stora tält där ett av dem är adornerat med massa symboler och märkningar tillsammans med en port gjord av ben som entré.Vi går närmare så jag kan titta genom griffonens ögon medan han flyger in. Väl närmare ser vi att symbolerna är abyssal.\nHan dyker in och där finns 3 stycken hobgoblins med bland annat Vesuvius. Ett bord, garderob, bokhylla och annat finns. Ser ut som att kartan de har på bordet inte nödvändigtvis är till kriget nu, då inget på ytan som just nu krigas på är markerad. Utan det är andra ställen i Aarid Province som är markerat på. Dessutom hör vi att de snackar om lite armé-saker som nog handlar om att trupper ska vara på vissa platser. Men även hör jag att de säger att “citadellet beordrar”. Vi diskuterar lite och kikar omkring hur vi ska göra. Vi kollade stora katapulten men det var fett många orcer där. Vi går istället in i VIP-arean (hobgoblin delen av campet). Det är lite besvärligt. Vi kör med Initiativ igång.\nVi påträffar were-boars här inne som har ihjäl lite orcs.\nJag fick använda min inspiration för att inte bli upptäckt.\nVi använde 4 charges på väskan för att använda Dimension Door och ta mig och Cory in i det markerade tältet som vi såg tidigare. Vi ska leta efter viktiga papper och kopiera dem. Vesuvius fightar lite mot were-boarsen och använder vad som verkar vara en eldritch blast på en av dem. Den han träffar försvinner i ett svart moln typ. Efter en runda kommer den tillbaks, död.\nWere-boarsen verkar ha väldigt hög regeneration generellt men här dog han snabbt..Cory kopierar kartan vi hittade och jag har letat efter annat. Men inte hittat något annat än en journal eller dagbok. Vi upptäckte att de har skrivit på common efter att vi tagit av oss halsbanden. Jag readyar Dimension Door igen så vi tar oss ut ifall det kommer in någon genom dörrn. Vilket det gör, så vi försvinner och kommer vidare. Dock höll Cory fortfarande kvar i vad som verkade vara Vesuvius journal, så den hängde med oss. Vi sov sedan utanför campet och på morgonen verkade det som att de tog ner campet för att förflytta sig vidare och vi drog oss tillbaks mot the capitol för att inte bli upptäckta.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#session"],"headers":[{"heading":"Current agenda","level":2,"id":"Current_agenda_0"},{"heading":"Goals","level":7,"id":"Goals_0"},{"heading":"Session Summary","level":2,"id":"Session_Summary_0"},{"heading":"Recap of last session","level":2,"id":"Recap_of_last_session_0"},{"heading":"Session Summary","level":8,"id":"Session_Summary_1"},{"heading":"Log","level":2,"id":"Log_0"}],"links":[],"author":"Rasmus","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-49-2025-06-08.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":["05_quests/current-goals-singwin-mistforger.md"],"createdTime":1750606445905,"modifiedTime":1750587014177,"sourceSize":4123,"sourcePath":"02_Journal/Thalbrine - Big campaign/Session 49 - 2025-06-08.md","exportPath":"02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-49-2025-06-08.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":228,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-50-2025-06-22-start-of-the-tyrfindal-arc.html":{"title":"Session 50 - 2025-06-22 - Start of the Tyrfindal Arc","icon":"","description":"\nHitta ett sätt att få hem Holger\nFixa ett material med ursprung från the Astral Plane\nHälsa på Semil Wildmagic i Bastion Shore\nKomma på ett namn på byn där Cecil och Arvid finns ![[]]Vi berättar lite först för Linus hur det gick till efter.\nPå vägen till the capitol märker vi att det i marken där krig har först är typ dött och ruttet till och från.

Kartan dock är lite mer oklar och tar mycket mer tid, vilket vi stannar för.\nDe anser dock att vårt uppdrag inte är klart så de vill använda oss mer.<br>Det kommer en som kallar oss till Generalen för mer information. Där inne står <a data-href=\"Gideon\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Gideon</a> och Tony och väntar redan. Vi pratar lite kort innan Generalen tar ton och snackar.De tror att Gnollsen kommer via portaler, för de kan INTE tagit sig hit med båt.\nDe tror att det finns en portal i Aarid Province som kanske skiftar mellan olika positioner på kartan, antagligen utifrån månfaser eller liknande. Dock med hjälp av ett nytt meddelande som kommit till journalen så ska nästa plats vara vid “Wardenwood” som det heter på Orcish. Sydvästra sidan av Aarid Province.

Gideon ber oss följa efter och han önskar pratar med oss utan att någon annan hör. Vi hänger med till en taverna en bra bit bort och han berättar att han tillsammans med <a data-href=\"Red Mages\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Red Mages</a> redan hittat en väg till <a data-href=\"Tyrfindal\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Tyrfindal</a>, den enda andra stora ön som vi inte har en väg till. Det är dussintals med mages som just nu arbetar med att bygga en portal mellan <a data-href=\"Helm’s Bearing\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/04_places/helm's-bearing/helm’s-bearing.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Helm’s Bearing</a> och <a data-href=\"Tyrfindal\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Tyrfindal</a>.Det som står på lappen vi hittade i Gnollgrottan är detta:\nA first order of justness,\na sin that holds no forgiveness.\nOur hunger still never sated.\nTimes have changed, and we waited.\nThe night will come again, bear witness!\nThe resilient spoils on the weakest...Gather the wolves of the North,\nThe Boars of the East,\nThe Snakes of the South,\nThe Ravens of West.Death to the Holy.Samma saker står även i alla pergament som wereboarsen hade på sig.

Det är där portalen håller på att byggas. Vi kan få skydd av mages där tills portalen är klar.\nGideon sa att vi kan få hyra hästar och Kronan betalar. Vilket vi då givetvis görCory ville ha lite potions så vi drog till en apothecary. Väl där råkar vi fråga om vi kan lägga det vi köper på Kronan oxå. Och det gör vi. Så vi handlar en del extra som kanske inte är nödvändigt annars. 1 Potion of Spell recovery\n2 Superior HP pots\n1 Essence of Rage\n1 Serpent’s Venom\n1 Invisibility potion\nSen rider vi iväg och tar det lite som en semester. Väl framme finns det knappt något alls där. Inget ljud, inga folk, knappt några djur heller. Hilmia försöker prata med djuren och skogen men de verkar avvikande och vill inte svara nåt. Vi letar och letar men hittar ingenting. Vi märker dock att ju längre tiden går och solen går ner desto mer döende blir skogen. Nu när solen i stort sätt är nere så är allt grått och dött. Vi funderar mer men fattar inget. Jag slänger Divination och frågar “Vart är portalen och hur tar vi oss dit?”Vi alla hör detta:\nDär dunkel skog, där skuggor bor, slingrar rötter ??. Man ledes fram till jordens famn, till en stuga täckt i mossa och damm.Hilmia gräver lite och letar bland rötterna från träden. Hon märker att alla rötter kommer ut från träden åt samma håll. De pekar och leder någonstans. Vi följer dem vidare och kommer till tjockare och tjockare dimma. Efter ett tag verkar vi se syner. Vi känner någon oro över att det är något som rör sig i den tjocka dimman, men bara Cory och Hilmia som verkar se något. Vi går vidare följandes rötterna. Efter ett tag ser vi tak och något som liknar en by på vänster sida, men den är helt öde och död. Ytterligare senare ser vi någon form av hus som kanske är dit vi ska. Vi går närmare och då ser vi humanoida former som cirkulerar oss och börjar komma närmare. Det verkar vara rötter som är formade i humanoider. Combat börjar.Vi har ihjäl de två mindre snubbarna och bara den stora kvar. Då kommer en äldre orch-kvinna ut ur huset vi är vid. Hon skriker och viftar med ett rykande löv och en pinne. Hon pekar på root-monstret och i respons springer den iväg, långt iväg. Hon börjar prata med oss på common, efter att hon tagit en blick på oss och ser att vi nog inte pratar orcish.\nTony frågor om stugan är full av damm.Hon välkomnar oss till “Wardenwood” på orcish. Hon säger att det inte finns någon portal här, när vi frågar. Men hon säger att hela området här flyttar på sig. Ungefär efter 2 veckor byter området från död och lidande till grönska och liv. Och efter 2 veckor byter det igen. och igen, och igen, och igen..<br>Hon heter <a data-href=\"Drusilla\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Drusilla</a>. Efter lite mer snack, välkomnar hon oss in i sin stuga på lite te. Vi frågar om portalen vi hört om men hon vet inget säger hon.\nHon har ingen källare hos sig som alla andra i byn. Vi kollar runt en del mer och frågar lite men får inte riktigt något hum vad som försiggår här. Hon är lite stissig. Vi säger något, hon får nån tanke och kollar ut en snabbis, sen tillbaks fort.\nTill slut skickar hon ut oss och vi kollar runt. Det visar sig att alla rötter runtomkring stugan leder till just hennes stuga. Det måste finnas mer info att få där.\nVi går runt och kikar och vi frågar om vi kan prata mer, men hon vill inte, hon behöver sin sömn. Vi funderar en sväng men allt är lite oklart. Vi beslutar oss sen att gå mot byn istället. Väldigt tomt och öde. Hilmia lyssnar på ett av husen och hör fotsteg under sig. Hon lyssnar sedan på en källar-dörr på utsidan av ett hus och hör fotsteg tydligare där. Någon är där och går.\nHilmia frågar sen “hallååå, är det någon där?”\nVi fortsätter prata en del med normal volym och till slut kommer en “SCHHHHSHHH!!, tyst för helvete! Vill ni inte överleva natten eller?!?” inifrån källaren.\nVi blir fett tysta. Men frågar viskandes vad de är rädda för. De svarar månen, när den kommer upp så kommer ett monster genom en portal. Och man vet inte vart den kommer. Jag säger att det är den portalen vi är ute efter, vi vill ha ihjäl det som kommer i den. Då börjar de prata mer och sen låser de upp. Vi öppnar och går in snabbt. Det är en hel del orcher.<br>\nVi snackar lite. Det visar sig att de är rädda för <a data-href=\"Drusilla\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Drusilla</a>, hon tar deras barn och de kan inte ta tillbaka dem för hon är skyddad av de där rot-monstren vi slogs mot. Det är hennes följeslagare. De blir jätteförvånade när vi säger att vi pratat med henne och vart inne hos henne. Vi nämner att Tony drack lite te och då blir de oroliga. För att de ska kunna lita på honom så behöver de prova så han inte är monster oxå, så de sätter en silverspik i handen på honom. När han inte vrålar av smärta pga silvret så är de nöjda. <br>Vi diskuterar mer och vi kommer fram till att vi hjälper dem att få tillbaks deras 7 kidnappade barn som <a data-href=\"Drusilla\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Drusilla</a> tagit. Vi hämtar fler orcher i 2 andra källare. Alla tar med varsin silverspik och sätter i toppen av en planka så de kan slå med den.\nSen går vi upp mot huset. Vi kollar mot stugan och ser att den stora root-grejen är där igen. Alla orcher kollar väldigt mycket ut mot skogen, det kanske är där de olika were-creaturesarna kommer ifrån. De går mer i skogen mot huset.\nTony dricker invis-potion för att vi tänkte han skulle smyga in när dörren öppnades. Men vi märker att det stora root-monstret följer efter Tony utan några problem, trots att han är osynlig. Så han springer ifrån huset istället och tar monstret med sig, medan vi andra går mot huset.\nVäl nära märker vi en skepnad uppå på taket, med en mörk huva. Vi ser bara grå/ljusa händer som sticker ut. Det är kanske en hag???Sen startar fight på riktigt.\nVi fightar ett tag. Efter en kort stund Misty Steppar hon upp på taket. Hon ropar att “hahahah det är FÖR SENT! Vill ni ha barnen? Ta dem!”. Hon låser upp dörren till källaren och upp kommer barnen. De omfamnas av sina föräldrar, bara några sekunder innan hår trycker sig ut ur huden på dem och långa betar växer sig ur käften på dem. Samtliga barnen börjar bita sina föräldrar. Dessutom hör vi massa fler wereboars utifrån skogen.\nVi går runt till källaren och det är något sken där. Det ser ut som en magisk cirkel. Vi överger tyvärr föräldrarna som fightar barnen. Vi går ner dit och inser att en Incantation behövs nog. Jag läser upp den som vi hittade hos en gnoll, som Gideon gav oss.

Finns stenpelare och grejer både framför och bakom oss. Det finns tomma braziers som säkert har brunnit förr men var länge sen nu.Hilmia sniffar och försöker se om hon känner igen något. Men det luktar typ inget alls, finns inget vanligt hon kan ta upp lukt ifrån.Vi börjar gå lite på mattan. Men bara några sekunder senare börjar lappen jag höll i som besvärjelsen stod i att lysa och flyga upp i luften. Den lyser starkare och starkare och till slut rivs sönder. Ljuset blir ännu ljusare och till slut bländande. Mitt i ljuset kommer två händer fram med långa fingrar sittandes på armar som glittrar. Ut klättrar Gideon.Han säger hej och berättar att vi verkar inte ha kommit dit vi tänkte. Vi är nog på ett annat plan.\nHan frågar lite hur vägen hit och och gällande Haggan vi träffade på och byn som var där.Vi kommer sen till en låst port som Gideon låser upp. Jag öppnar dörren och vi kommer till ett större öppnare område med tända facklor. Det finns 9 portar till utöver den vi kommer ur. Vi funderar på vilken vi ska välja och Tony väljer en port vi går mot. Hilmia lyssnar på en närmare dörr dock först och hör någon snacka där bakom. Vi beslutar oss att öppna dörrn och ser att det är par wereboars som pratar.\nVi säger att det är såna vi har träffat tidigare och de inte är så trevliga. Gideons svar på detta är att börja gå mot dem för vi kanske kan fråga dem om vägen. Han går fram med oss bakom och frågar om vägen, det är säkert någon av dem som har koll.\nEn av wereboarsen går fram till Giden och säger att han är en lustig typ samtidigt som han drar sitt vapen. Gideon svarar med att skära halsen av honom och slänga en spell som suger ur allt ur hans kropp, då kroppen blir typ uttorkad. Till slut är det bara en tom husk kvar på marken. De andra reagerar lite hårt på detta. Gideon frågar igen om någon kan visa vägen, då de uppenbart kan common. De svarar att de kan hjälpa oss, “hehehehe…”. Så vi leds iväg och Gideon börjar småprata med oss. Vi behöver försöka få reda på är: varför sprider de sig så mycket (Wereboarsen)?Gideon frågor oss om vad ska vi göra sen då? När vi kommer hem igen? Har vi något att göra?\nVi funderar lite och jag svarar till slut att jag skulle vilja ha lite metall från the Astral Plane, men det känns besvärligt att ta sig dit.\nGideon svarar att det kanske finns en portal som går dit! samtidigt som han misty stepar fram och knackar en wereboar på axeln och frågar dem om det finns en portal till Astral Plane här, vilket det gör. Så Gideon frågar mig om jag vill gå dit?!\nJag säger att ja jo men vill ju kunna komma hem oxå! Han svarar att ja men det löser sig!Så vi börjar gå till en annan port. Porten är dekorerad med olika mönster men delvis 6 stycken fågelklor runt om. Den wereboar som inte var förvandlad blir tillfrågad av Gideon om hur man öppnar portalen. Han svarar att han inte tänker berätta men han kan öppna. Gideon vänder sig om och tittar mot oss och vinkar fram oss. Porten öppnas och det är ett stort hav framåt.Innan vi går in lägger Gideon Sanctuary på alla oss som håller 1 timme, så länge vi inte attackerar någon så kan ingen attackera oss.\nGideon trollar fram en båt till oss och blåser i oss i den och vi flyter iväg. Vi frågar honom, “ska inte du med?”. Han svarar att “hahah nej, vi kan ju inte låta detta vara kvar här, eller hur?” säger han och gestikulerar mot alla portar och wereboars vi sett. “men hur kan vi komma hem sen??”. “Det löser ni på nåt sätt, det är lugnt” säger han medan hans hand börjar lysa starkt rött och portalen stängs. Vi åker i båten på havet och bara glider fram och pratar lite.\nJag berättar lite om hur det är här och att distans inte riktigt fungerar som man tror, utan handlar mer om tid. Om man vill ta sig någonstans så behöver man bara tänka det. Cory tänker att han vill hem och båten börjar direkt dra iväg.Jag säger att vi ska försöka hitta något här, åtminstone någon metall så vi får ut något av det. Jag minns plötsligt en fras som brukade sägas till unga feathren:\n”Alla griffons hittar hem till fadern”. Direkt när jag tänker den så rör sig båten igen.\nEfter ett tag flyter vi mot något som sakta blir större och större. Till slut ser vi något växa och det verkar vara en stad, som ser ut som en ancient romersk stad. Med ett stort palats.\nDet mesta är gjort i någon blå sten och allt är väldigt vackert dekorerat o dant.Vi börjar se figurer och de är allihop Feathren. När vi kommer ännu närmare ser vi ett skepp vid sidan av med fler figurer, Githyanki och andra formlösa varelser. Vi hör också ljud av svärd som klingar och skal som knäcks. Skeppet har tentakler som verkar föra den framåt. Men en kort stund senare försvinner skeppet iväg. Vi ser snart att sfärliknande figurer med mekaniska vingar närma sig oss. De sträcker fram typ händer som vill ta emot och hjälpa oss. De pratar massa olika språk och till slut säger någon på common “KAN VI ERBJUDA NÅGON HJÄLP?!” om och om igen. Vi svarar att det är ganska lugnt men vi vill ta oss till palatset. De svarar “INGEN HJÄLP BEHÖVS” och flyger iväg.Vi kommer nära och ser figurer som tittar mot oss. Vi stannar vid bryggan och går upp. Båten sjunker ner i vattnet och försvinner efter vi lämnat den. När vi kommer mot stadig mark står en feathren med 4 armar och stoppar oss och säger “Ni står inte med på listan på besökare för idag.. Vad har ni för affärer?”Jag nämner att jag heter Singwin och har varit här för länge sen men minns inte riktigt. Visar också väskan och då släpper han förbi oss direkt. Tony säger oxå att vi letar efter Bagge. Han svarar då att “Ah, din handler, ja om ni tar till höger och följer vägen där så kommer ni till en som ser ut som mig men är en Lorekeeper, säg att du är Singwin och att du söker din Handler”.Så vi följer vägen och går framåt. Vi möter mycket feathrens som bär på saker, vagnar som dras av griffons.\nVi ser sedan en feathren med endast två armar med en huva på, vars armor ryker under sig. Han har även ett vapen, en klinga, vid sin sida. Han ser ut som en krigare typ.När vi närmar oss tittar han upp men tittar snart ner igen. Men kort därefter tittar han på mig en gång till och verkligen stirrar. Sen kommer han fram och tittar upp och ner på mig. Han frågar sen “Vad heter du?”, jag svarar och han börjar le lite, “Vad gör du här?” Jag blir fundersam men svarar på frågan. Han säger att det var länge sen! Kul att se dig igen!\n“Har vi träffats förut? Jag kommer inte ihåg. Vem är du?”\n“Det kan jag inte berätta tyvärr. Men kul att se dig.” Sen går han tillbaks.Vi går vidare till vad som verkar vara Lorekeepern. Han ropar till alla som går förbi honom om vilka grejer de ska ha och vart de ska. Konstant ropar han till olika folk.\nJag går fram dit och säger vem jag är och att jag vill till min handler. Han letar i sitt pergament. Han hittar mig och säger att det är i “det tornet där”.\nVi går dit och knackar på, en välbekant röst svarar “kom in” och vi öppnar.\nVi hälsar och han välkomnar oss in. Det är Bagge. Han är en ganska stor griffon med 6 armar. Han sitter ner som en katt, på en minimal pall och alla armarna arbetar med att flytta grejer. Vi hälsar och börjar prata lite.\nSamtidigt vi börjar gå in så krymper han i storlek. Medan vi pratar så krymper han mer och mer. Han frågar lite hur vi kom hit och varför vi är här.\nHan tar också upp att tiden går annorlunda. Ingen kan veta hur lång tid det gått sen vi kom hit.\nVi diskuterar lite saker. Vi pratar delvis om min historia. Och han nämner att jag ville att det skulle bli så här. Det var mitt beslut. Och det är också mitt val att jag inte ska minnas något. Därför kan han och får han inte berätta^singwininfoLevo, heter en smith som vi kan prata med och kanske få tag i någon bra metall. Det kommer in en snubbe med en stor stav. Den tar Bagge och typ skannar Hilmias själs-tråd. Han ser då att själen är svag, det är bara en tredjedel av hela hennes själ. Vi går ut därifrån. När vi kommer ut tränger sig en feathren förbi oss med en bident och säger “de vill inte ta emot denna….” och dörren smälls igen.Vi går ner till lorekeepern igen och frågar om Levo. På vägen till Levo ser vi en flock av de där flygande sfärarna, första gången vi faktiskt ser någon annan varelse än feathren eller griffons på denna platsen.\nNär vi kommer närmare dit vi vill så finns det mycket stora forges och andra arbetsstationer. Vi ser ett stort torn som det står “Wildmagics enchanting” på. Vi öppnar dörren och blir stoppade av en magisk rustning som frågar vad vi har för ärende. Vårt ärende blir godkänt så vi får gå in.Vi träffar en helvit feathren, som verkar vara den enda som arbetar här. Han vänder sig mot oss och frågar vad vi vill. Jag nämner att jag vill ha ett material som denna kan använda. Tony ville fixa så hans breastplate gör is-skada istället för eld. 250gp.\nCory skulle vilja ha en sköld som är bra. Han har fått två exempel. 1250gp eller 1000gp och en pryl han kan tycka är najs. Cory ger honom sin cloak och sen prutade jag ner till 907gp. Jag bidrog med 200gp av dem. Så Cory köpte en anti-magic sköld.Alec är en smed som Levo rekommenderade, efter att jag nämnde vem jag var och att jag vart här förut.\nLevo är tydligen bror till Semil Wildmagic. Vi fick säga hej till honom genom en magisk spegel, och han blev VÄLDIGT intresserad av hur vi tog oss hit. Jag lovade därför att vi ska hälsa på honom när vi är tillbaka. Tony vägrar vänta så han går direkt till Stora G för o prata.\nAlec är en leopard/snöuggla som står o dricker.\nVi diskuterar lite och om jag vill ha en rustning ska jag nog prata med en tailor istället, då jag inte kan ha någon armor på mig.\nVi kollar på det och jag o Jacob ska prata mellan sessions för o välja nåt bra.Tony lyckas få en audiens med Stora G, gällande sina visioner. Vi möter Tony strax efter att han kommit ut. Vi pratar lite. Han säger att han inte är helt nöjd med svaret han fick och frågar lite om föremålen som Stora G håller i.Vi går ner till bryggan igen och då kommer en Lorekeeper och pratar med oss. Han säger att han kanske kan hjälpa oss komma hem:\n”En av våra Dockmasters behöver hjälp, jag är skyldig honom en tjänst. Han kanske kan i utbyte mot ett jobb ge oss en säker resa hem.”Så vi går dit och pratar med honom. Jacob har tre olika one-shots som sker i Astral Plane som vi kan köra. Han ska läsa igenom dem och sen får vi nog välja någon av dem.Jag o Jacob snackade lite själv gällande Tailor-visiten Singwin gör. Singwin fick 4 alternativ på items att välja. Jag får läsa vad alla gör, förutom den sista.\nDark Fathom Armor\nRobe of Stars\nMoonswaddled Armor\nEn mystisk jag inte får veta något om.\nDe två första var lite coola, den tredje lite tråkig. Men att ge mig ett mystiskt item är ju garanti för att jag ska välja det. Så jag gjorde det.\nDet kostade mig mina Gauntlets of Eldritch Ferocity som jag craftat själv, min Elven Chain och Tonys gamla half-plate armor.\nDet enda jag fick veta om den mystiska armoren är detta, efter att jag köpte den:^darkleatherarmor\n<img alt=\"Dark Leather Armor - Part 1.jpeg\" src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/items/dark-leather-armor-part-1.jpeg\" target=\"_self\"> ","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#session"],"headers":[{"heading":"Current agenda","level":2,"id":"Current_agenda_0"},{"heading":"Goals","level":7,"id":"Goals_0"},{"heading":"Session Summary","level":2,"id":"Session_Summary_0"},{"heading":"Recap of last session","level":2,"id":"Recap_of_last_session_0"},{"heading":"Log","level":2,"id":"Log_0"}],"links":[],"author":"Rasmus","coverImageURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se","fullURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-51-2025-07-13.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":["05_quests/current-goals-singwin-mistforger.md","00_attachments/items/dark-leather-armor-part-1.html"],"createdTime":1753890900278,"modifiedTime":1753620706244,"sourceSize":12057,"sourcePath":"02_Journal/Thalbrine - Big campaign/Session 51 - 2025-07-13.md","exportPath":"02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-51-2025-07-13.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":230,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-52-2025-07-27.html":{"title":"Session 52 - 2025-07-27","icon":"","description":"\nHitta ett sätt att få hem Holger\nFixa ett material med ursprung från the Astral Plane\nHälsa på Semil Wildmagic i Bastion Shore\nKomma på ett namn på byn där Cecil och Arvid finns ![[]]Vi går till en dockmaster som likt nästan alla oxå är en feathren. Han är ljusblå och vagt gul med en Tabby nederdel. Han har oxå en silverthread likt vi har som stryker längsmed honom.Det står ett skepp i kajen som vi nog ska åka med. Det ser ganska vanligt ut, men det saknas segel. Stora master men inget som är fäst i dem.När han är redo att sätta av så vänder han sig till oss och säger att han inte kan ta med några fler till material plane. Vi säger att “han där borta sa att du kunde ta oss om vi hjälpte dig”.\nDå vände han och sa att hmm ja ni kanske är äventyrare av den våldsamma sorten? Ge mig en stund så ska vi lasta ur.\nSå vi väntar en stund. Men vi känner oss inte utvilade alls efter vad som brukar vara 30 min.\nTirun (dockmaster) kommer och säger att vi kan åka. Han garanterar inte att vi överlever, då det är ganska farligt osv osv. Men det är vi väl vana vid tänker han.Båten åker iväg på samma sätt som vi åkte Gideons båt innan.Hans uppdrag är att vi ska hämta ett objekt, i syfte är inte att han ska använda det utan snarare se till att ingen ska ha det. En grupp av Drow har ett objekt som han vill ha. Vi tror att häxan vi slogs mot i den mörka skogen ropade på Drows.\nEn blomma, en Void Lotus. Man kan använda den blomman i någon form av mörk ritual för att göra sig kraftfullare eller odödlig ish.\nBlomman finns hos Drows nu och han vill att vi tar den ifrån dem.\nVi kommer åka till ett tempel. Vi snackar lite skit ett tag. Innan vi går ut och kollar vart vi befinner oss. Vi ser ett oändligt hav. Han säger till oss att hålla fast i något. Strax efter så slår skeppet igenom nån form av barriär och skeppet tar sig igenom. Vi ovana börjar lyfta från skeppet. Tirun säger att det bara är att tänka att man vill stå kvar så gör man det. Vi försöker och lyckas till slut.Vi ser sen några FETT stora typ guldfiskar med tre stjärtfenor och tre stora lila ögon. Som tur är, var de en av de få vänliga varelserna.\nVi möter ett stort skepp, som alla börjar titta emot och är lite rädda. Tirun frågar om inte vi kan ta hand om snacket, då de kanske känner igen honom. Han säger dock att de inte är efter oss, utan de har mycket större mål de vill ha.\nVi får en egen eka som vi åker mot det andra skeppets eka.Vi känner inte igen skeppet men vi kan känna igen figurerna som åker i den. Githyanki. 4 stycken hoppar ur sin båt.\nDe hoppar omkring och undersöker området lite. Sen kommer en fram till oss och frågar argsint varför vi är här och vad vårt mål är. Vi försöker svara så ärligt vi kan utan att berätta att vi letar efter Drows. Men de går inte riktigt på det, de litar inte på oss säger han. “Dra era vapen!” säger han och fight börjar.Under fighten så använder jag min nya armors Fog Cloud och det kommer en megastor dimma. Ingen kan se igenom den. Men jag märker att jag kan se jätteklart i denna dimman, det blir inte något jobbigare alls att titta igenom. Jag känner oxå att jag kan transportera mig igenom molnet. Jag kan använda min movement till att förflytta mig som längst min movement vart som helst i molnet och teleportera dit.När det bara är en Gith kvar, så börjar han prata med Tony som är närmast. Han är övertygad om att vi är slavar till Mindflayers. Tony försöker snacka vett i honom.\nTill slut lyckas Tony lugna honom och vi pratar lite grann. Han kan typ tänka sig att släppa oss, men han vill först undersöka någon av oss och Tony sa i respons att han vill undersöka någon av dem.Githen undersöker Cory. Han tar ett fast tag runt huvudet och trycker in ett finger under o tittar noggrant under Corys ena öga. Han ser att det är lugnt. Tony kollar githens blod och får lite info.\nVi kommer överens om att vi släpper han fri och han oss. De kommer inte störa oss längre.På väg tillbaks till vår lilla båt plockar jag och Hilmia två stycken half-plates och två greatswords från två av de döda.Vi åker tillbaks till stora skeppet och Tirun tackar för att vi löste problemet och ville vara säker på att vi inte ska behöva hantera dem längre, vilket vi konfirmerar. Han undrar sen om vi inte är sugna på lite vin, då vi ser lite illa tilltygade ut. Vi fattar inte riktigt men visst, vi kan dricka lite.Han häller upp varsitt glas till oss som vi dricker. Vinet är av blå färg. När vi druckit det så känner vi oss väldigt utvilade och får massa energi tillbaks. Vi får en long rest.Jag identifyar armor och svärd vi plockade upp och fick veta att det är Psionic Ward armor och Silver Sword, båda bra för githyankis, men inte oss andra.Vi åker vidare en bra stund och när vi senare går ut så kommer vi till något område som ser ut som att något en gång suttit ihop men inte gör längre. Vi ser flera trasiga stora skepp och saker som ser ut som byggnader och annat trasigt.\nVi ser även lite djur; valar och hajar.Vi åker vidare vad som känns som ett dygn. Vi är kvar i samma väldigt trasiga område. Vi ser berg förstörda och i många delar runt omkring. Vi ser något som ser humanoidt ut. Något jättestort. Ett oerhört stort lik med kroppsdelar som är avkapade. Vi har nog aldrig sett något så här stort. Det är säkert flera kilometer långt. Kroppen har inristningar eller tatueringar som lyser lätt.Vi frågar Tirun. Han berättar att det är en gammal gud som är sen länge förgången. Han styrde över våra hav för länge sedan. Nånting om att det finns aboleths i våra hav oxå, som en gång i tiden kontrollerade världen. Efter en stund åkande till så ser vi vår slutdestination. Det ser knappt ut som ett tempel. Det lyser lite ifrån det, kanske är det bebott eller bara underhålls det.\nBesättningen slänger en spell som skapar en bubbla runt hela skeppet. Någon form av disguise så vi inte syns. Tirun kommer till oss och pratar lite. Han ger oss en gåva inför att vi ska in. Vi får varsin liten flaska som ger en shortrest om vi dricker den över 10-15 minuter.Borgen är formad som ett H. I mitten av den horizontala bryggan, växer blomman öppet på ett altare i en liten skål med vatten. Void Lotus används för att uppnå oändligt liv. Han vill ha den själv, vi ska inte ge den till bagge.De kommer stanna i trakterna ett bra tag, tills antingen de tror att vi är döda eller tills vi kommer. Han är dock osäker på hur vi ska ta kontakt med dem. Antingen lite eldritch blasts eller en mini griffon eller något.De släpper av oss och de drar iväg.Borgen är nog ett monastery. Hilmia undersöker växtligheten en del. En del av dem verkar vara från Divided Wilds och Aarid Province. De lever, men inte helt, utan verkar vara pausade eller sövda.Hilmia nämner oxå att hon känner nån doft efter insekter. Vi hör strax efter sen ett flaxande och ett riktigt högt rytande från det som flyger. Vi kan inte se det, men det är något rätt så stort.Vi funderar lite. Cory upptäcker att de stora kedjorna som håller i bryggan går in i borgen, strax ovanför där den går in finns ett fönster, som vi nog tänker ta oss in via. Vi klättrar lite på en kedja och Cory tar sig upp till fönstret. Tyvärr verkar det inte så smidigt att öppna, utan vi behöver pajja fönstret.\nVi tänker vi går runt borgen och rekar lite.En bit åt ena hållet ser vi en del spindelnät och sedan ett hål under borgen. Ett stort stort hål som går snett nedåt in mot borgen och är riktigt högt i tak. Vi bestämmer oss att gå i grottan/tunneln trots Hilmias motsägelser. Det är så pass stort så vi kan gå två i bredd. Vi gör dock inte det.\nEfter en kort stund, 20-30 meter, kommer vi till någon form av källare som är helt länsad. <a href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se?query=tag:Inspiration\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#Inspiration\">#Inspiration</a> gick till mig tror jag pga. delvis Singwin locoloco","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#session"],"headers":[{"heading":"Current agenda","level":2,"id":"Current_agenda_0"},{"heading":"Goals","level":7,"id":"Goals_0"},{"heading":"Session Summary","level":2,"id":"Session_Summary_0"},{"heading":"Recap of last session","level":2,"id":"Recap_of_last_session_0"},{"heading":"Log","level":2,"id":"Log_0"}],"links":["?query=tag:Inspiration"],"author":"Rasmus","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-52-2025-07-27.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":["05_quests/current-goals-singwin-mistforger.md"],"createdTime":1757960281939,"modifiedTime":1757959130718,"sourceSize":8277,"sourcePath":"02_Journal/Thalbrine - Big campaign/Session 52 - 2025-07-27.md","exportPath":"02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-52-2025-07-27.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":231,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-53-2025-09-14.html":{"title":"Session 53 - 2025-09-14","icon":"","description":"\nHitta ett sätt att få hem Holger\nFixa ett material med ursprung från the Astral Plane\nHälsa på Semil Wildmagic i Bastion Shore\nKomma på ett namn på byn där Cecil och Arvid finns ![[]]Vi är i källaren. Haggans Pass without Trace håller fortfarande. Vi tänker vi ska smyga oss vidare och försöka hålla oss okända.\nDock är det fett mörkt och alla har inte dark vision. Så hur vi ska göra med ljus är oklart i nuläget.\nCory kör med sin lykta. Vi går igenom hålet i väggen. Verkar leda till en smal korridor med fängelsehålor med sidorna som har sträckbänkar i. Vi följer vägen och kommer till mer galler och grejer. Vi ser också att all spindelväv är tjockare och tjockare.\nVi ser två sträckbänkar till som har två stora humanoidformade spindelnät i. Vi funderar på om vi ska öppna någon av dem.\nTony tar initiativ och skär upp en av dem. Ligger en kropp där som är superdupergammal och helt uttömd på vätska. Jag vill se om jag kan hitta nåt av värde i kokongen, jag hittar en pouch som innehåller två scrolls och en potion. Hittar en till potion hos den andra. Potions står på undercommon och ser ganska lika ut. En scroll ser ut som att det är en spell scroll\nDen andra är lite mer oklar. Hilmia tror att det kan vara ett språk från de lägre planen, typ Infernal eller Abyssal. Tony håller med.\nTill slut kommer vi ut och då har vi säkert gått förbi ett 50-tal celler. Där kommer vi till trappor som går både upp och ner. Vi börjar gå nedåt först. Vi går nedför massa trappor och det kommer större och större sprickor längsmed väggarna. När vi väl är nere på plan mark verkar väggarna flyga för att det är så stora sprickor.\nNere på botten kommer vi endast till en stor port i trä. Vi beslutar att vi ska försöka ta oss igenom den. Väl inne finns det faktiskt lite ljus här. Lite braziers och annat som ger lite ljus. Finns två passager som leder till samma sak. En pedistal med ett altare på. Det finns en bild på någon. Tony minns att hans morbror pratat om olika demoner, och detta är nog en avbild av någon Oni. Det finns dessutom en liten skål nedanför och två utbrända ljus. Vi kan sedan gå vidare och kommer ut till mer av ett rum som även den andra passagen leder till. Vid ett annat rum ser vi ett superstort timglas med någon ljusblå sand som faller hela tiden, oavsett vilket håll den är på när den roterar runt. Den verkar ha kommit halvvägs. Vi går sen vidare till det andra lite större rummet. Ett till timglas som verkar sitta fast med kedjor. Sitter fast i något som ser ut typ som en sån man hissar ankare med.Hilmia hittar att sanden som finns i rummen häromkring är ganska naturligt fördelat, som sanddynor. Det ser dock ut som att något har gjort hål i sanden med jämna mellanrum. Av de två vägar vi kan gå framåt nu är en av dem fylld med sand och den andra lite tamare. Vi väljer den med mindre sand. Väl vidare kommer vi till någon tomb/grav i form av en oktagon. Graven i mitten står det inte vem det är. Vi funderar lite vart vi ska ta vägen. Vi provar en annan dörr som är lite blockerad av sand. Vi går vidare iallafall och kommer till ett betydligt större rum. Men så fort vi öppnar den dörren kommer en Phase spider bakifrån och attackerar mig och en framför som attackerar Cory. Vi slåss en del och märker att de inte är så starka, dör ganska lätt. Under fighten drar Cory och Tony i spakarna som är vid dörren och sen knuffar Cory upp den. Rummet blir fett mycket större och är mängder av stjärnor o ljus där inne. Även några spindlar till.Vi pangar alla utan större problem och skador och börjar utforska det stora rummet. Finns några gravar och urnor runt om i rummet. Längst bort i änden är det en stor glassfär. Vi kan i den se en spegelbild av där vi är, men där ingenting är trasigt. Den har en stor barriär runt sig.\nTony och Hilmia vill undersöka närmare och liksom ta sig in. Vi andra är inte riktigt lika säkra på det. De två går o kollar en grav men det gav inte mycket mer info.\nVi ska gå tillbaka lite o undersöka. Vi provar att hålla fast ett timglas och provar att snurra på en som satt fast. Vi provar fler saker, bland annat släppa lös alla timglas. Efter det möts vi tre utan Cory vid en av de första vi hittade som satt fast i marken. Det visade sig att den gick att snurra på marken och då får man sanden att flytta sig åt ena eller andra hållet. När vi snurrar motsatt håll från först tills det tar stopp så tappar sanden sin färg och all sand är på ena änden av timglaset. Vi går till stora rummet igen där Cory är. Barriären har slocknat och det är mycket mörkare här nu. Alla andra timglas hade också slocknat.Vi funderar på om vi kan göra något med denna nu när skölden är borta. Vi spånar lite men kommer inte på något vettigt. Hilmia flyger upp med gaseous form för att titta lite. Hon berättar att det verkar vara en tron i spegelbilden istället för porten som vi har i detta rummet. Och på tronen sitter en person eller staty som håller händerna på ett svärd som är nerstucket i marken.\nVi är lite osäkra på om vi faktiskt ska göra detta. Tony och Hilmia vill väldigt gärna ta sig igenom. Vi kastar ett mynt och ser att den faller igenom på andra sidan.\nHilmia kan ta sig igenom med hjälp av att bli fågel, Tony med sin grappling hook, jag kan nog lägga fly, men Cory är lite oklart. Han kan kanske hoppa igenom.\nHilmia blir fågel, tittar igenom och sen flyger igenom. Då ser vi en fågel sen som flyger runt i glaset. Hon kommer tillbaks och direkt då hoppar Tony in från väggen han tagit sig till med sin grappling hook. Fågeln flyger in igen och jag lägger Fly på mig samt Cory hoppar in. Snubben på tronen sitter blixtstilla. Han har ett ganska ovanligt svärd. Rustningen verkar vara något ifrån Outland. Tony går närmare mot snubben på tronen. Tony drar sitt svärd och han känner att detta, detta är en värdig motståndare.Tony lägger något gift på sitt svärd. Jag flyger upp en bra bit upp i luften medan jag ändå har fly. Hilmia blir en cave bear med rustning. Tony crittar på sin första träff och gör 103 skada, mha Purple Worm Poison. Vi lyckas få ner honom. Vi alla tog rätt mycket skada men potions hjälpte en hel del. Endast Cory downade.Onin sätter sig på knä och tappar sitt svärd. Tony absorberar typ Onins själ och får en ny kraft i sitt svärd.\nSvärdet har nu ingen magi kvar men jag märker att metallen är speciell. Så jag stoppar ner svärdet. Vi tar oss ut sen och tar en short rest och sen avslutar. <a href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se?query=tag:Inspiration\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#Inspiration\">#Inspiration</a> går till Cory för bl.a. hans fighting moves för att rädda oss.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#session"],"headers":[{"heading":"Current agenda","level":2,"id":"Current_agenda_0"},{"heading":"Goals","level":7,"id":"Goals_0"},{"heading":"Session Summary","level":2,"id":"Session_Summary_0"},{"heading":"Recap of last session","level":2,"id":"Recap_of_last_session_0"},{"heading":"Log","level":2,"id":"Log_0"}],"links":["?query=tag:Inspiration"],"author":"Rasmus","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-53-2025-09-14.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":["05_quests/current-goals-singwin-mistforger.md"],"createdTime":1757960281951,"modifiedTime":1757959140725,"sourceSize":6982,"sourcePath":"02_Journal/Thalbrine - Big campaign/Session 53 - 2025-09-14.md","exportPath":"02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-53-2025-09-14.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":232,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-54-2025-10-13.html":{"title":"Session 54 - 2025-10-13","icon":"","description":"\nHitta ett sätt att få hem Holger\nFixa ett material med ursprung från the Astral Plane\nHälsa på Semil Wildmagic i Bastion Shore\nKomma på ett namn på byn där Cecil och Arvid finns ![[]]Efter vi tagit oss ut ur specialrummet så tar vi en short rest och jag harvestar lite av spindlarna. Hilmia hjälpte till.\nVi går sen tillbaks och backtrackar lite. Försöker sen att ta oss vidare iväg för att hitta blomman till slut. Vi kommer till lite olika rum och passerar bland annat mögliga tavlor och flera platser där det ser ut som att folk har campat.\nVi kommer till en större sal sen. Där hittar vi en cirkel av runor och lite förbi den en barriär vid en port. Vi funderar på om cirkeln gör något men jag går in o ställer mig i den efter en kort stund. Inget händer. Tony får snilleblixten att det kanske krävs ett command word, och går in o säger “Like the Wind!” som jag o Haggan skrattar åt.\nHilmia använder Detect Magic och känner någon JÄTTEsvag känsla av Transmutation magic både i cirkeln och en mycket större känsla från samma skola av barriären i porten där. Cory kastar ett mynt igenom barriären och så snart hela myntet är igenom så försvinner det. Hilmia tar fram en lite ödla, Tommy, som går igenom men så snart han är igenom kommer han tillbaks ut.\nVi funderar lite sen går Tony in och kommer direkt ut fast med draget svärd. Det visar sig att tiden går mycket långsammare för de som är utanför än de som är innanför. Det tar ytterligare tid innan Singwin fattar, och Cory tar med honom för att visa.Vi går sen in allihop igenom porten och kommer till någon sal med en form av tron, som ser ut kanske som en hövdings tron, tillsammans med bord och stolar. Vi ser något som ser ut som en sfär mellan tronen och bordet som snurrar jättefort.\nHilmia hittar typ ett litet altare med torkat blod i.\nCory hittar sen en bok som kändes intressant. Verkar vara handskriven, men texten i den går inte läsa. Men både Tony och Hilmia känner igen den. till slut kommer vi på att vi hittade ett pergament med samma typ av text i en kokong.\nVi funderar lite. Men sen tänker vi att vi kanske kan snurra på den där timglasgrejen vi hittade i källaren. Så vi springer ner och gör det, sen går vi upp igen och in genom porten igen. Då ser vi att den snurrande sfären är faktiskt ett timglas, som nu snurrar jättelångsamt istället. Vi ser att timglaset har arcanerunor på sig. Ser inte riktigt ut som de andra timglasen. Hilmia tar hjälp av sin Lizard för att nå upp till timglaset och peta på den, snurra lite och sen hålla fast den. Hon tar sen med den ner på marken.Jag får tanken att blodet kanske har hänt något med nu, så tipsar Tony om det. Han svarar “aaaa.”, och sen händer inget. Efter många sekunder kommer Tony på att han ska gå o kolla blodet. Och det visar sig att blodet nu är flytande. Han försöker läsa blodet, men verkar inte lyckas. Varelsen som hade blodet är bara oerhört gammal, ancient. Det är allt han kan få ut.Hilmia funderar på boken, så vi tar upp den och nu finns det fler sidor på den. Flera av sidorna som var bortrivna är nu tillbaks. Bland annat ser vi någon bild och något ord på Arcane som verkar vara något commandword.Jag och Hilmia hjälps åt och vi lyckas lösa ordet till: Ras’Godai“Your heart imbued, your soul shackled. Ras’Godai remain protected, until your awakening.”Vi diskuterar en hel del om vad vi ska göra. Vi har typ två val, antingen gå ut o säga command-grejen eller typ leta vidare i andra rum.\nVi bestämmer oss för att säga commandorden. Väl gjort så hör vi genom barriären att timglaset spricker och exploderar. Alla dess delar försvinner ut i stoft. Dessutom försvinner barriären. Rummet vi ser nu är en tredje version av rummet. Här finns massor av döda drows, som dött på olika sätt. De flesta av klingor/svärd, men andra har bitmärken, riktigt stora bitmärken. Altaret som tidigare hade blod i sig är nu sprucken helt. Vi börjar höra flaxande och skrin långt utifrån och ser en skugga passera ett hål i taket. Den vill vi inte ha att göra med, vi går tillbaks till där ringen var och kollar lite andra rum. Hittar inget speciellt. Går ner till källaren igen och där är alla timglas trasiga och ligger på marken. Även det superstora är trasigt och sand är i nästan hela rummet. Inget annat av intresse…Vi fortsätter höra skrin och flaxande medan vi letar vidare i så många rum vi kan.\nDet visar sig när vi funderar sen, att vi har nästan BARA varit på ena sidan av H:et. Vi tror att vi nog ska längre uppåt, till ett torn vi har sett tidigare. Men vi FATTAR INTE hur vi ska ta oss dit. Vi hittar inga trappor. Vi går tillbaks till cirkeln och då kommer jag på att jag har hittat en spell scroll. Hilmia läser den och det är en “Scroll of Grand Levitation”. Hilmia försöker slänga den medan vi står på cirkeln, men scrollen är kvar. Det visar sig att Cirkeln är imbuad med samma spell, och hela cirkeln som en stor platta börjar lyfta och flyger uppåt. Under tiden inser jag också att jag har två potions jag inte vet vad det är. Jag använder Identify på dem under tiden vi flyter uppåt.\nNär vi kommer upp så är vi precis utanför tornet. Vi går på en passage in mot tornet och pausar när vi ser att det finns några filurer här, 4 stycken Drow, som pratar på Underdark.\nTvå av dem står vid ett blodigt altare, där en är mer klädd som trollkarl och håller i en kniv med vågigt blad med en handen och en stav i andra. Han skjuter upp i luften med sin stav och än en gång hör vi drakens skrik. Längre bort förbi detta altaret ser vi något helt nytt. Något okänt, alien. Dens form är någorlunda lik vår med två armar och ben. En grön varelse med väldigt gula ögon som tittar oss rakt in i själen. <a href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se?query=tag:Inspiration\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#Inspiration\">#Inspiration</a> till Singwin","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#session"],"headers":[{"heading":"Current agenda","level":2,"id":"Current_agenda_0"},{"heading":"Goals","level":7,"id":"Goals_0"},{"heading":"Session Summary","level":2,"id":"Session_Summary_0"},{"heading":"Recap of last session","level":2,"id":"Recap_of_last_session_0"},{"heading":"Log","level":2,"id":"Log_0"}],"links":["?query=tag:Inspiration"],"author":"Rasmus","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-54-2025-10-13.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":["05_quests/current-goals-singwin-mistforger.md"],"createdTime":1760510692446,"modifiedTime":1760379636786,"sourceSize":6137,"sourcePath":"02_Journal/Thalbrine - Big campaign/Session 54 - 2025-10-13.md","exportPath":"02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-54-2025-10-13.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":233,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-55-2025-10-26.html":{"title":"Session 55 - 2025-10-26","icon":"","description":"\nHitta ett sätt att få hem Holger\nFixa ett material med ursprung från the Astral Plane\nHälsa på Semil Wildmagic i Bastion Shore\nKomma på ett namn på byn där Cecil och Arvid finns ![[]]Rollar initiativ direkt när vi startar och fighten är igång.\nCory använder sin <a href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se?query=tag:inspiration\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#inspiration\">#inspiration</a> i fighten för att rädda sig från en breath attack.\nBara någon enstaka runda in i fighten så försvinner Hilmia och Tony in i en portal. Vi ser dem inte på många rundor.\nEfter ett tag i fighten så använder jag min nya Dark Leather Armor för att ta fram ett Fog Cloud. Jag använder den för att gömma mig ett tag. Draken som flugit är med i fighten och chillar i min fog en stund. Jag lyckas skjuta loss ryttaren och senare även skjuta in han i portalen som Hilmia och Tony hamnade i. Hilmia och Tony upptäcker att vattnet på den konstiga plats de är på faktiskt helar dem. <br>Jag har fokus att skjuta på de mindre fienderna och låta draken vara. Men efter en stund gömmer sig alla små fiender och bara draken syns. Då bestämmer jag mig för att knuffa in den i portalen också, och jag lyckas, men det krävde att jag använde min <a href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se?query=tag:inspiration\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#inspiration\">#inspiration</a>.

Strax därefter, letar en av de större fienderna efter mig, men kan inte hitta mig i fogen, så han går för Cory och dödar honom. Cory är <a href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se?query=tag:död\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#död\">#död</a>.Jag upptäcker här att fienden har en kedja med en kristall i, som glimmar och pulserar en del. Jag använder Dispel Magic och får totalt 20. Kristallen Dispellas och portalen försvinner. Portalen kommer istället upp där Hilmia och Tony är. De går in i den och kommer tillbaks till mig, där portalen va på vår sida.De hjälper till att attackera den farliga gröna fienden. Han känner sig rätt skraj där verkar det som, för han teleporterar bort och vi förlorar honom. Endast en mage kvar som blir FETT rädd när han är själv kvar mot oss. Han tappar sin stav, trillar baklänges och börjar krypa bakåt. Jag tar upp boken som låg på ett altare där samt en tiara när vi går mot honom. Jag tänker att vi kanske kan fråga ut han någonting, men han verkar vägra när vi kommer fram och har en klar överhand. Han säger att vi är kassa varelser och han bara avskyr oss och de vi är. Bakom honom finns en kvinnlig kropp under en genomskinlig sjal typ, med något som glimmar i händerna på kroppen. Det är blomman vi letar efter, Void Lotus. Jag tar den och lägger i min portable hole. Vi går sen till Cory igen, där Hilmia är. Hon går omkring runt Cory och funderar. Hon unshapear och berättar att hon kanske har en lösning. Hon vill att vi hämtar allt vi kan som är på borden runtomkring.

Hon slänger Reinkarnation och Jag o Tony väntar fett länge på att det ska hända något, men det tar en himla tid.\nDet ser ut som att mycel/svamp har satt ihop Corys kropp igen. Bröstkorgen som varit helt uppbruten och delad. Detta sitter nu ihop igen med mycel. Cory sätter sig upp efter Hilmia är klar. Han ser mycket blekare ut och hans hy har blivit lite mer en orange färg. Hans bröstkorg lyser, pulserar som ett hjärta gör. Jag o Tony blir rätt förvirrade. Hilmia vet inte själv riktigt vad som har hänt. Cory känner sig okej. Vi pratar lite och catchar upp men vi känner snabbt att vi vill dra härifrån. Vi signalerar så gott vi kan på vägen ner och möter skeppet när vi kommer ut ur monasteriet. Vi kliver på och de hälsar på oss. Vi sätter oss tillsammans runt ett bord o slappnar av lite. Vi är tillbaks i hamn om kanske 7 dagar.\nSmåsnackar ett tag. Hilmia känner något om att hon har gjort något sånt här tidigare, vilket hjälpte henne förstå att hon kunde göra det alls.Vi sover lite och jag identifyar sen staven och tiaran; Staff of Power och Crown of Whirling Comets. Tony tyckte den lät najs så han får den, i gengäld önskade jag en kram vilket jag fick. Han tar av sig sitt Belt of Dwarven kind som Hilmia tar istället. På vägen hem så kommer de där soul-cordsen tillbaks till oss. Strax efter (relativt sett) kommer vi tillbaks till Feathren-staden. Tirun ville inte ha blomman, men han leder oss till ett kontor där en större griffon vill ta emot den. De ställer lite frågor gällande om vi har använt blomman eller ej och om vi har upplevt något lurigt. Men de är tacksamma att vi bara har haft den i mitt portable hole. Medan vi pratar med griffonen får Tony något av en ålderskris för att hans knän börjar bli dåliga. När Tony är klar med sin kris, så går vi iväg och Tirun tar med oss iväg. Han förklarar att vägen tillbaks är inte så smidig. Det bästa för oss, för att vi faktiskt ska klara resan så behöver vi Astral Projecta våra själar till Astral Plane medan våra kroppar förs hem till Material plane. Vi kommer nog att vara fett utmattade ett bra tag framöver. Tirun säger att någon av högre rang borde nog slänga denna spellen, så vi leder honom till Bagge.Vi pratar med honom när Tirun ger han ett kontrakt som Bagge signerar. Vi diskuterar lite till innan han påbörjar spellen. Han slänger den i 1 timme innan något händer. Tony tröttnar något oerhört på att det tar en sån tid. Vi flyter upp och sen släpps vi ut ur våra vanliga kroppar som faller ner på marken med varsina dunsar. Våra silver cords är nu kopplade mellan vi som flyger och våra kroppar på marken. Tirun öppnar en väska och kör ner våra kroppar där. Sen efter ett tag frågar Bagge, \"hur vill ni göra?\". Vi fattar inte helt. Så han säger, \"ja, det är dags att dö. Hur vill ni dö?\". Vi blir fett tagna från ingenstans. Men tänker lite.\nTony bestämmer sig för att skära sig själv, så han ska skära i halsen och handlederna. Men när han är på väg säger Bagge att \"NEJ inte där, akta mattan\". Han pekar in mot hörnet och visar Tony en hink. Tony går dit och ställer sig i hinken när han innan han skär sig. Vi andra tre hinner allihop dö på varsina sätt innan Tony dör.\nBagge går till Hilmia och tar sin stora klo/tass grej och knäcker nacken på henne, men det blir bara en knäckning, den bryts inte. \"Oj då\" säger Bagge. Samma sak sker två gånger till innan han nästan sliter av hennes huvud och hon försvinner. Cory önskar dö fort och det löser han.\nJag önskar också dö rätt fort men vet inte hur, så frågar Bagge vad han rekommenderar. Han tar fram ett gäng vapen men de tilltalar inte riktigt. Han går o plockar ner en potion som kan hjälpa mig somna in säger han. Jag går mot han men snubblar och sätter en yxa i skallen, tar en kort stund dock innan jag somnar in, så Bagge stampar hårt på mig så det går lite fortare.\nUnder tiden ligger Tony i hinken och gurglar och bara väntar på att få somna in. Vi vaknar upp på en okänd plats med 1hp och 3 levels av exhaustion. Fett trötta. Det känns som att vi hamnade på Aarid Province, antagligen den södra delen.\nVi short restar allihop för att få tillbaks lite hp. Strax efter hoppar en man i läderrustning och kappa ner nära oss. Under kappan glimmar en dolk. En pil kommer emot oss och landar mellan oss allihop. Det är ett gäng banditer som kommer emot oss. Hilmia säger till dem när pilen viner förbi. \"Det där är en dum idé...\".\"Men glöm inte bort.

Under ritualen fick Hilmia obehagliga viskningar och visioner, och en spöklik figur observerades. Vidare undersökningar ledde dem till ett träsk där de besegrade en Corpse Flower, men valde att dra sig tillbaka när fler hot uppenbarade sig. Morgonen därpå berättade Tomar om Elisa, en halfling som försvann spårlöst från byn för fem år sedan. Gruppen bestämde sig för att söka upp Cecil, ägaren till tavernan Svarta Rosen, och jägaren Arvid i byn för att få mer information om försvinnandet.\nTomar tar med oss till sin gård.

Ställer nån fråga om oss som Tomar svarar på och sen går han ut tillsammans med henne. När vi nästan sovit våra 8 timmar kan vi höra ett ylande säkert en kilometer bort. Vi tre blir av med en level av exhaustion oxå.\nHilmia framförallt. Hon får viskningar, visioner och känslor från marken och området. Det hon får till sig är att hon stör någonting och behöver lägga av omedelbart.

Jag o Cory hänger med, men Tony ville ligga kvar och sova.När vi kommer ut så ser vi någon genomskinlig figur som tittar mot oss, eller iaf ger den känslan. Den är spöklik och ger en obehaglig känsla i kroppen. Men den försvinner ganska fort och bara fadear ut. Vi kommer till Hilmia och diskuterar lite. Hon berättar om viskningarna och vi berättar om spöket vi såg. Vi är lite spooked. Vi tycker kanske inte det känns så bra att fortsätta…Vi funderar men Hilmia bestämmer sig för att avsluta. Vi tror att vi borde prata med Tomar bl.a. Hilmia tror att det kan vara någon som har dött här men inte fått lämna på rätt sätt. Vi tänker att vi kan kolla om Tony vill hänga med, så jag går o hämtar honom. Jag förklarade lite om vad som hänt, men han ville då oxå se spöket för att vilja hänga på. Vi kommer ut och vi kollar om Hilmia kan framkalla spöket igen, men hon lyckas inte. Tony försöker istället med någon magi han har.\nVi funderar lite till gällande spöket och vi tror att det antingen kan vara ett barn, eller en halfling/gnome. Tony får lite information om vad det skulle kunna vara för spöke, men delar det inte. Han önskar gå till där vi såg spöket. Vi går dit, Cory tänder sin lykta och Tony försöker leta spår, men hittar inget. Jag ber Hilmia sniffa efter något och hon känner något förmultet, något dött. Hilmia använder sin <a href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se?query=tag:inspiration\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#inspiration\">#inspiration</a> för sniffen. <br>Vi går en bit och kommer fram till ett träsk. Det finns en hel del dödskallar o grejer som är liksom invuxna i träd och vines. Hilmia känner att detta INTE är en bra plats som vi ska stanna på, vi borde dra härifrån. Men de känner ändå att vi borde känna lite. Hilmia och Cory tänker känna lite på området, då kommer ett doftmoln av något som tvingar dem göra en const save, båda failar. Även Cory trots att han använde en <a href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se?query=tag:inspiration\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#inspiration\">#inspiration</a>. De blir incapacitated.\nJag o Tony ser att vinesen och skallarna i dem formas till något monster.\nHär rollar vi för initativ.En Corpse Flower kommer fram och börjar attackera oss.\nVi lyckas övervinna den och när den dör så droppade den 9st lik runtom sig. Hilmia svampifierar ett av liken och tar det med sig.\nJag spejar lite runt efter den dog, och märker en till som går mot oss. Vi känner att detta inte är helt 100 för oss. Så vi börjar dra härifrån och gå tillbaks. Hilmia släpper liket hon tog så vi inte råkar skrämma livet av Tomar och Estra.Hilmia känner sig fett trött o Tony vill också vila mer, så vi chillar för natten och pratar med dem imorn istället.På morgonen kommer Tomar och knackar på, och blir prompt livrädd när Hilmias lizard står precis innanför dörren. Vi säger att vi behöver prata och han bjuder in oss att prata över frukost inne i huset. Hilmia tar upp ämnet om att hon rekommenderades sluta med ritualen. De har ingen som har dött på något sätt här på gården, men de nämner att någon har försvunnit inne på byn. Det finns en taverna som heter Svarta Rosen. En halvling har försvunnit nån gång för ett tag sen, Elisa.\nMitt i natten, typ 5 år sen. Hon hade bott själv ett tag för att hennes make hade försvunnit tidigare. Hon hördes skrika mitt i natten och man hittade blodspår i hennes hem men man hittade henne aldrig. Vi får tips om att gå till byn o prata med folk där. Så kan vi kanske undersöka hennes hem. Tomar rekommenderar att gå till Cecil som äger Svarta Rosen i byn. Han är svår att missa. Äldre, bär monokel och är en hobgoblin. Svår att missa. Han ser över allting gällande byn. Han är dessutom en gammal äventyrare. Vi börjar gå mot ”byn”.Nästa uppdrag för oss blir att söka upp Cecil och Arvid, samt att övertyga Tony om att vi ska göra detta.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#session"],"headers":[{"heading":"Current agenda","level":1,"id":"Current_agenda_0"},{"heading":"Goals","level":7,"id":"Goals_0"},{"heading":"Summary","level":1,"id":"Summary_0"},{"heading":"Log","level":1,"id":"Log_0"}],"links":["?query=tag:inspiration","?query=tag:inspiration"],"author":"Rasmus","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-58-2025-12-08.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":["05_quests/current-goals-singwin-mistforger.md"],"createdTime":1765269007185,"modifiedTime":1768235664117,"sourceSize":6452,"sourcePath":"02_Journal/Thalbrine -

They see magic as a complex system waiting to be decoded and then harnessed in their spells and inventions. You can find everything you need to play one of these inventors in the next few sections.Artificers use a variety of tools to channel their arcane power. To cast a spell, an artificer might use alchemist's supplies to create a potent elixir, calligrapher's supplies to inscribe a sigil of power, or tinker's tools to craft a temporary charm. The magic of artificers is tied to their tools and their talents, and few other characters can produce the right tool for a job as well as an artificerHit Dice:&nbsp;1d8 per artificer level\nHit Points at 1st Level:&nbsp;8 + your Constitution modifier\nHit Points at Higher Levels:&nbsp;1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per artificer level after 1stArmor:&nbsp;Light armor, medium armor, shields\nWeapons:&nbsp;Simple weapons\nTools:&nbsp;Thieves’ tools, tinker’s tools, one type of artisan’s tools of your choice\nSaving Throws:&nbsp;Constitution, Intelligence\nSkills:&nbsp;Choose two from Arcana, History, Investigation, Medicine, Nature, Perception, Sleight of HandYou start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:\nany two simple weapons\na light crossbow and 20 bolts\n(a) studded leather armor or (b) scale mail\nthieves’ tools and a dungeoneer’s pack\nAlternatively, you may start with 5d4x10 starting goldThe secrets of gunpowder weapons have been discovered in various corners of the D&amp;D multiverse. If your Dungeon Master uses the rules on firearms in the&nbsp;Dungeon Master's Guide&nbsp;and your artificer has been exposed to the operation of such weapons, your artificer is proficient with them.1st-level Artificer feature\nAt 1st level, you've learned how to invest a spark of magic into mundane objects. To use this ability, you must have thieves' tools or artisan's tools in hand. You then touch a Tiny nonmagical object as an action and give it one of the following magical properties of your choice:\nThe object sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.\nWhenever tapped by a creature, the object emits a recorded message that can be heard up to 10 feet away. You utter the message when you bestow this property on the object, and the recording can be no more than 6 seconds long.\nThe object continuously emits your choice of an odor or a nonverbal sound (wind, waves, chirping, or the like). The chosen phenomenon is perceivable up to 10 feet away.\nA static visual effect appears on one of the object's surfaces. This effect can be a picture, up to 25 words of text, lines and shapes, or a mixture of these elements, as you like.\nThe chosen property lasts indefinitely. As an action, you can touch the object and end the property early.You can bestow magic on multiple objects, touching one object each time you use this feature, though a single object can only bear one property at a time. The maximum number of objects you can affect with this feature at one time is equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one object). If you try to exceed your maximum, the oldest property immediately ends, and then the new property applies.You've studied the workings of magic and how to cast spells, channeling the magic through objects. To observers, you don't appear to be casting spells in a conventional way; you appear to produce wonders from mundane items and outlandish inventions.You produce your artificer spell effects through your tools. You must have a spellcasting focus - specifically thieves' tools or some kind of artisan's tool - in hand when you cast any spell with this Spellcasting feature (meaning the spell has an \"M\" component when you cast it). You must be proficient with the tool to use it in this way. See the equipment chapter in the Player's Handbook for descriptions of these tools.After you gain the Infuse Item feature at 2nd level, you can also use any item bearing one of your infusions as a spellcasting focus.1st-level Artificer feature\nAt 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spells:artificer\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spells:artificer\" target=\"_self\">artificer spell list</a>.

To cast one of your artificer spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.<br>You prepare the list of artificer spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spells:artificer\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spells:artificer\" target=\"_self\">artificer spell list</a>. When you do so, choose a number of artificer spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your artificer level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.<br>For example, if you are a 5th-level artificer, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:cure-wounds\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:cure-wounds\" target=\"_self\">Cure Wounds</a>, you can cast it using a lst-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of artificer spells requires time spent tinkering with your spellcasting focuses: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your artificer spells; your understanding of the theory behind magic allows you to wield these spells with superior skill. You use your Intelligence whenever an artificer spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an artificer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.Spell save DC&nbsp;= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier\nSpell attack modifier&nbsp;= your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifierYou can cast an artificer spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.2nd-level Artificer feature\nAt 2nd level, you've gained the ability to imbue mundane items with certain magical infusions, turning those objects into magic items.<br>When you gain this feature, pick four&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/artificer:infusions\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/artificer:infusions\" target=\"_self\">artificer infusions</a>&nbsp;to learn. You learn additional infusions of your choice when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Infusions Known column of the Artificer table.Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer infusions you learned with a new one.Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a nonmagical object and imbue it with one of your artificer infusions, turning it into a magic item. An infusion works on only certain kinds of objects, as specified in the infusion's description. If the item requires attunement, you can attune yourself to it the instant you infuse the item. If you decide to attune to the item later, you must do so using the normal process for attunement (see the attunement rules in the&nbsp;Dungeon Master's Guide).Your infusion remains in an item indefinitely, but when you die, the infusion vanishes after a number of days equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 day). The infusion also vanishes if you replace your knowledge of the infusion.You can infuse more than one nonmagical object at the end of a long rest; the maximum number of objects appears in the Infused Items column of the Artificer table. You must touch each of the objects, and each of your infusions can be in only one object at a time. Moreover, no object can bear more than one of your infusions at a time. If you try to exceed your maximum number of infusions, the oldest infusion ends, and then the new infusion applies.If an infusion ends on an item that contains other things, like a bag of holding, its contents harmlessly appear in and around its space.3rd-level Artificer feature\nAt 3rd level, you choose the type of specialist you are. Your choice grants you features at 5th level and again at 9th and 15th level.3rd-level Artificer feature\nAt 3rd level, you've learned how to produce exactly the tool you need: with thieves' tools or artisan's tools in hand, you can magically create one set of artisan's tools in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. This creation requires 1 hour of uninterrupted work, which can coincide with a short or long rest. Though the product of magic, the tools are nonmagical, and they vanish when you use this feature again.4th-level Artificer feature\nWhen you reach 4th level, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.6th-level Artificer feature\nAt 6th level, your proficiency bonus is now doubled for any ability check you make that uses your proficiency with a tool.7th-level Artificer feature\nAt 7th level, you've gained the ability to come up with solutions under pressure. When you or another creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an ability check or a saving throw, you can use your reaction to add your Intelligence modifier to the roll.You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.10th-level Artificer feature\nWhen you reach 10th level, you achieve a profound understanding of how to use and make magic items: You can attune to up to four magic items at once. If you craft a magic item with a rarity of common or uncommon, it takes you a quarter of the normal time, and it costs you half as much of the usual gold. 11th-level Artificer feature<br>\nAt 11th level, you can now store a spell in an object. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch one simple or martial weapon or one item that you can use as a spellcasting focus, and you store a spell in it, choosing a 1st- or 2nd-level spell from the&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spells:artificer\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spells:artificer\" target=\"_self\">artificer spell list</a>&nbsp;that requires 1 action to cast (you needn't have it prepared).While holding the object, a creature can take an action to produce the spell's effect from it, using your spellcasting ability modifier. If the spell requires concentration, the creature must concentrate. The spell stays in the object until it's been used a number of times equal to twice your Intelligence modifier (minimum of twice) or until you use this feature again to store a spell in an object.14th-level Artificer feature\nAt 14th level, your skill with magic items deepens more:\nYou can attune to up to five magic items at once.\nYou ignore all class, race, spell and level requirements on attuning to or using a magic item.\n18th-level Artificer feature\nStarting at 18th level, you can attune up to six magic items at once.20th-level Artificer feature\nAt 20th level, you develop a mystical connection to your magic items, which you can draw on for protection: You gain a +1 bonus to all saving throws per magic item you are currently attuned to. If you're reduced to 0 hit points but not killed out-right, you can use your reaction to end one of your artificer infusions, causing you to drop to 1 hit point instead of 0.

On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action.While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren't wearing heavy armor:\nYou have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.\nWhen you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table.\nYou have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.\nIf you are able to cast spells, you can't cast them or concentrate on them while raging.Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.Once you have raged the number of times shown for your barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again.1st-level Barbarian feature\nWhile you are not wearing any armor, your armor class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.2nd-level Barbarian feature\nAt 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren't as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger. You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can't be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.2nd-level Barbarian feature\nStarting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.3rd-level Barbarian feature\nAt 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of your rage. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.3rd-level Barbarian feature\nWhen you reach 3rd level and again at 10th level, you gain proficiency in one skill of your choice from the list of skills available to barbarians at 1st level.4th-level Barbarian feature\nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.

If you drop to 0 hit points while you're raging and don't die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead.Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10.15th-level Barbarian feature\nBeginning at 15th level, your rage is so fierce that it ends early only if you fall unconscious or if you choose to end it.18th-level Barbarian feature\nBeginning at 18th level, if your total for a Strength check is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.20th-level Barbarian feature\nAt 20th level, you embody the power of the wilds. Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4.

These warriors transform their bodies into powerful moving bunkers that are as difficult to take down as they are to escape from.Barbarians that follow this path are often trained hunters who enjoy the patient stalking of prey. They thrive on the&nbsp; peril they impose on their fleeing targets, and take special pride in their slow-and-steady approach.3rd-level Path of the Glacier feature\nStarting when you choose this path at 3rd level, your skin becomes icy and tough to the touch. You gain resistance to cold damage, and while you’re not wearing any armor, you gain a +1 bonus to your AC.In addition, your rage is a cold and patient well of power. When your rage would end early due to you either not attacking or taking damage, you can choose to maintain it instead. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.3rd-level Path of the Glacier feature\nAlso at 3rd level, you can unleash the unforgiving cold inside of you with your attacks. Once on each of your turns while you’re raging, you can release a burst of sheer cold when you hit a target with a melee weapon attack. When you do, that target takes an extra 1d6 cold damage from the attack. This damage increases when you reach certain levels in this&nbsp; class, increasing to 2d6 cold damage at 10th level and 3d6 at 14th level.When a creature takes cold damage in this way, its speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.6th-level Path of the Glacier feature\nBy 6th level, you learn to further channel the icy resilience within you. When you enter a rage and are not wearing any armor, your skin becomes shielded by a protective layer of frost. This frost grants you a number of temporary hit points equal to 1d12 + your Constitution modifier that last for 1 hour.You can use a bonus action on your following turns while you’re raging to expend a Hit Die to gain these temporary hit points again. When you do, the number of temporary hit points you gain is equal to the maximum roll of the expended Hit Die + your Constitution modifier.10th-level Path of the Glacier feature\nAt 10th level, you can choose to enter a deep state of hibernation when you take a long rest. While resting in this way, you’re cold to the touch and appear dead to all outward inspection and to spells used to determine your status. Noise and other distractions fail to wake you.You awake from this rest after 6 hours, when you take damage, or when a creature uses its action to slap you awake. If you finish a continuous 6 hours of sleep in this way, you gain the benefits of finishing a long rest, and you regain all expended Hit Dice.14th-level Path of the Glacier feature\nAt 14th level, you become as mighty as an unstoppable glacier. As an action, you can stomp the ground to send out a magical tremor. All creatures of your choice within 15 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier). On a failed save, a creature takes bludgeoning damage equal to 3d6 + your Strength modifier and is knocked prone. This action counts as an attack for the purpose of maintaining your rage.<br><a href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se?query=tag:TheGriffonsSaddlebag_BookTwo\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#TheGriffonsSaddlebag_BookTwo\">#TheGriffonsSaddlebag_BookTwo</a><br>\n<img alt=\"Barbarian - Path of the Infernal.webp\" src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/classimages/barbarian-path-of-the-infernal.webp\" target=\"_self\">\nBarbarians are known far and wide as being some of the most relentless warriors in existence, entering terrifying rages that fuel their attacks and allow them to shrug off even the most staggering of blows. A barbarian’s presence and capabilities depend largely on the source\nof their rage, such as from a sense of greater purpose, bloodlust, or deeper, spiritual connection. Regardless of where this fount of rage comes from, barbarians are always feared and respected for their brutal talents.You have found the conduit for your rage in something scarier than anything you’d find on the Material Plane. Your inner fury burns from the hells themselves, manifesting itself as a series of fiendish transformations and flames whenever you enter a rage. The origin of this power may have been a near-death experience that showed you the Lower Planes, or perhaps it came from a soul-binding contract with a powerful devil. Some tieflings may find that this strength has resided within\nthemselves all along as part of their infernal heritage. Regardless of your reason for having these abilities, one thing is certain: hell hath no fury quite like you.3rd-level Path of the Infernal feature\nStarting when you choose this path at 3rd level, one of your hands transforms into a large, fiery claw whenever you enter your rage. The claw remains for the duration of your rage. If you’re wielding a weapon with the clawed hand, its flames harmlessly spread to the weapon it’s holding and wreath it in magical flames. The first target you hit with this fiery weapon on each of your turns\ntakes an extra 1d6 fire damage. If you don’t deal this fire damage with a weapon attack on your turn, you can use a bonus action to make an unarmed strike with the claw, provided it’s empty. On a hit, the target takes the normal damage from your unarmed strike, which can be either bludgeoning or slashing damage (your choice), plus an extra 1d6 fire damage. The claw’s fire damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 1d8 at 6th level, 1d10 at 10th level, and 1d12 at 14th level.3rd-level Path of the Infernal feature\nAt 3rd level, you learn to speak, read, and write either Abyssal or Infernal (your choice). In addition, you can add your Strength modifier to any Charisma (Intimidation) or Charisma (Persuasion) check you make when interacting with fiends.When you reach 10th level in this class, you can add your Strength modifier to any Charisma (Intimidation) check you make when interacting with any creature, instead of only fiends.6th-level Path of the Infernal feature\nBy 6th level, the infernal fire within you burns hot even while you’re not raging. You gain resistance to fire damage.In addition, when you use the Attack action to grapple a creature while you’re raging, the target takes your Hellfire Claw’s fire damage if your grapple check succeeds, and again at the end of each of that creature’s turns while it remains grappled.10th-level Path of the Infernal feature\nAt 10th level, you can make minor deals with an interested archfiend or similar power to peer into the minds of other creatures and exploit their fears. You can use an action to spend 2 Hit Dice, without regaining any hit points, to cast the detect thoughts spell. The DC for this spell is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier.14th-level Path of the Infernal feature\nStarting at 14th level, when you take damage from a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you while you’re raging, you can use your reaction to release a punishing flame from your claw toward them, duplicating the effect of the hellish rebuke spell (3rd-level version, DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier). You can use this ability twice per rage.<br><a href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se?query=tag:RyokosGuideToTheYokaiRealms\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#RyokosGuideToTheYokaiRealms\">#RyokosGuideToTheYokaiRealms</a><br>\n<img alt=\"Barbarian - Path Of The Kaiju.webp\" src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/classimages/barbarian-path-of-the-kaiju.webp\" target=\"_self\">The Path of the Kaiju is one of sheer destructive force. Some warriors of this kind are fueled by a relentless hatred of a kaiju, perhaps one that destroyed their home or ravaged their continent. In such cases, an individual’s burning obsession is a source of incredible strength, manifesting as an aspect of the kaiju’s own power in moments of blind rage. Other barbarians might worship kaiju for their strength and grandeur, calling on their aid in battle, embodying the might and fury of a colossus as they charge into the fray.3rd-Level Path of the Kaiju Feature\nWhen you adopt this path, choose a kaiju through which you draw power and gain the associated benefit from the options below.\nThe Ascendant Dragon. While raging, you can use an action to let loose a devastating blast of radiant energy from your mouth. Each creature in a 15-foot cone must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your Strength modifier + your proficiency bonus), taking 2d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Taking this action counts as making an attack for the purpose of maintaining your rage. The damage of this feature increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (3d10), 11th level (4d10), and 17th level (5d10).\nThe Eternal Leviathan. When you enter your rage, or as a bonus action while raging, you can bellow an echoing cry. Each creature of your choice within 10 feet of you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus) or have disadvantage on attack rolls against any target other than you until the start of your next turn.\nThe Titan Earth. You can use your Constitution modifier in place of your Strength modifier for Strength checks, as well as for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and weapon attacks. These checks and attacks are still considered Strength-based for the purposes of your other features. In addition, you gain tremorsense out to 10 feet.\nThe Armoured Kabuto. While raging, if you move at least 15 feet straight towards a target and then immediately hit it with a weapon attack, the target takes an extra 2d8 bludgeoning damage from the attack.\nThe Infinite Tempest. The first time each turn while raging that you hit a target with a melee attack roll, you deal 1d6 lightning damage to each creature of your choice within 5 feet of the target as lightning spirals out from the point of impact.\nYou can switch your chosen kaiju each time you gain a new barbarian level.\n3rd-Level Path of the Kaiju Feature\nYou gain proficiency in the Medicine and Survival skills. If you already have this proficiency, you gain proficiency in another skill of your choice. Additionally, you can take the Brace action, stand up from prone, or mount a creature using only 5 feet of movement.6th-Level Path of the Kaiju Feature\nWhen you enter your rage, you can increase your size and the size of your equipment. If you are smaller than Large, you become Large, and any objects you are wearing or carrying increase by the same relative amount; your weight increases by a factor of 8 for each size category increased. If you lack the room to become Large, you grow to the maximum attainable size. This growth lasts until your rage ends. Objects enlarged by this feature that are no longer in contact with you at the end of a turn return to the size they were before this feature affected them. While in this form, you can add your Constitution modifier to all Strength checks and Strength saving throws, and your weapon attacks deal an extra 1d4 damage on a hit.10th-Level Path of the Kaiju Feature\nYou gain the power to transform into a vassal of a kaiju when you rage. This kaiju can be the same as your Aspect of the Kaiju feature, or a different one.\nThe Ascendant Dragon. While raging, you and any objects you are wearing or carrying assume a pseudo-liquid form. In this form, you have resistance to fire damage, you are immune to the grappled and restrained conditions, you gain a swimming speed of 60 feet, you can move through other creatures’ spaces and through gaps as small as 1 inch wide without squeezing (but you can’t stop there), and you gain the benefits of half cover while submerged in water.\nThe Eternal Leviathan. While raging, you adopt a translucent, ghastly form. In this form, you have resistance to cold and necrotic damage, and you can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. You take 5 force damage if you end your turn inside an object or creature. If you are inside an object or creature when your rage ends, you are shunted to the nearest unoccupied space and take 5 force damage for every 5 feet travelled.\nThe Titan Earth. When you use your Kaiju Force feature, if you are smaller than Huge, you become Huge instead of Large, along with anything you are wearing. In addition to the effects of that feature, your reach increases by 5 feet, and your weapon attacks deal an extra 1d4 damage on a hit (2d4 extra damage total) until your rage ends.\nThe Armoured Kabuto. While raging, you sprout large, insectoid wings. You have a flying speed equal to your walking speed, and opportunity attacks against you have disadvantage.\nThe Infinite Tempest. While raging, you crackle with lightning and your blows land with booming claps of thunder. In this form, you have resistance to lightning and thunder damage, and you can use a bonus action to move in a straight line up to 30 feet, passing through other creatures without provoking opportunity attacks. Each creature you pass through in this way must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus) or take 2d6 lightning damage.\n14th-Level Path of the Kaiju Feature\nWhile you are raging and have hit points equal to or less than half your hit point maximum, your speed increases by 10 feet, and you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action. Furthermore, if you fail a saving throw, you can choose to succeed instead. You can use this feature to succeed on a saving throw a number of times equal to half your Constitution modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.<br><a href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se?query=tag:LArsenesLedger\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#LArsenesLedger\">#LArsenesLedger</a>\nThe right drink is welcome on any occasion. Mayhaps you want to invigorate your body ahead of a bloody brawl, ruminate over a moral quandary, celebrate a sensational dragon slaying, or fill your veins with liquid bread after a hard day’s slog through the elements. Knowing which drink to suggest for which occasion—and having that drink on hand—is what separates a lay brewer from a brewmaster. For a brewmaster, the act of brewing—a process which can take months—is a practice in mindfulness. Carrying their barrels and demijohns from place to place, you would be mistaken to construe these individuals as peaceful. This apparent tranquillity is but the calm before the storm, for when a brewmaster enters a rage, they do so fueled by the fermented products of their labours.3rd-Level Path of the Brewmaster Feature\nYears spent experimenting in breweries and kombucha clubs have given you a taste for fermentation and experience in bar room brawls. You gain proficiency with brewer’s supplies and improvised weapons, and you have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls you make with improvised weapons. When you reach 6th level in this class, attacks made with improvised weapons count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. When you reach 10th level in this class, the attack and damage bonus increases to +2.3rd-Level Path of the Brewmaster Feature\nThe act of refining ingredients, maintaining special yeast cultures, and carefully monitoring a brew’s progress is a ritualistic practice through which you find connection with your forebears and the natural world around you. The beverages you brew are fortified with the spirits of your ancestors, imparting enhanced benefits to you. When you finish a long rest, you can use brewer’s supplies to prepare a number of beverages equal to the number shown for your barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian table (maximum 6), choosing from the list below (you can choose the same option more than once). When you enter a rage, you can imbibe one of these beverages (choosing from those that you prepared) as part of the bonus action you use to enter the rage, gaining its benefits for the duration of the rage.

You have advantage on Wisdom saving throws.Dark, liquid bread is a bona fide meal replacement. You gain 1d4 temporary hit points at the start of each of your turns. If you have fewer than half your maximum hit points, you instead regain 1d4 hit points. These dice both increase to 1d8 when you reach 10th level in this class.6th-Level Path of the Brewmaster Feature\nOver time, you’ve imbibed an amalgam of experimental yeasts that have fortified your gut. When you finish a short or long rest, you gain one of the following benefits of your choice, which lasts until you finish a short or long rest:You have resistance to cold damage.You have resistance to poison damage.You are immune to the frightened condition.

The creature gains 3 temporary hit points at the start of each of its turns.14th-Level Path of the Brewmaster Feature\nYou have grown a strain of super yeast within yourself that you can activate when you enter a rage. When you drink one of the beverages from your Ancestral Spirits feature, you can enhance the drink to gain an additional benefit based on its type.You are immune to poison damage and the poisoned condition, and you have advantage on saving throws made to avoid or end the exhaustion condition on yourself.Creatures provoke an opportunity attack from you when they move within your reach.Your

On a failure, the creature is paralysed until the end of its next turn\n6th-level College of Fleshweaving feature\nOver the course of 10 minutes, you can perform a surgical ritual on creatures that you can see within 60 feet of you (including yourself), up to a number equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). The creatures gain one of the following adaptations for the next hour. You choose one adaptation to affect all creatures:\nBull’s Buns. The target has advantage on Strength checks, and counts as one size larger when determining its carrying capacity and the weight it can push, drag, or lift.\nCactus Skin. The target is covered in razor-sharp spikes. At the end of each of the target’s turns, each creature grappling it must make a Constitution saving throw against your bard spell save DC. On a failure, a creature takes piercing damage equal to your Bardic Inspiration die and releases the target from its grapple. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and doesn’t have to release the target. Cat’s Paws. The target has advantage on Dexterity checks. It also doesn’t take damage from falling 20 feet or less if it isn’t incapacitated. Fish Form. The target can breathe underwater and gains a swimming speed equal to its walking speed.\nOwl’s Sight. The target has advantage on Wisdom checks and initiative rolls.\nRhino’s Hide.

While soulsewn, an ethereal thread connects you to this creature via a straight line that only you and creatures with truesight can see. This thread breaks if the creatureis ever more than 100 feet away from you.\nSpool. You can use a bonus action to teleport to the nearest unoccupied space of a soulsewn creature of your choice, or attempt to switch places with a soulsewn creature. If the creature is unwilling to switch places, you must succeed on a contested Charisma check against the creature. On a success, or if the creature is willing, you and the target teleport, switching places with one another. If there is not enough space for either of you to switch places, you automatically lose the contest.You can teleport using this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.<br><a href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se?query=tag:TheGriffonsSaddlebag_BookTwo\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#TheGriffonsSaddlebag_BookTwo\">#TheGriffonsSaddlebag_BookTwo</a><br>\n<img alt=\"Bard - College of Mercantile.webp\" src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/classimages/bard-college-of-mercantile.webp\" target=\"_self\">\nA good musician may be inspirational, but not to the same degree that a true bard can muster. Using sheer control over the simple magic of everyday comforts like music, song, and welcome conversation, bards are capable of twisting the world, and the people within it, to their liking. Bards are well-learned by trade, and as a result are capable of almost anything through gathered\nknowledge and uncanny aptitude. Often lauded as much as they are reviled by those they encounter, these practicioners of clever enchantments and illusions do their best work from the sidelines of combat and at the heads of powerful tables.Bards of the College of Mercantile are well versed in the artistry of cutting deals and enemies alike in order to come out ahead. Talented merchants, smugglers, and tradesmen alike all learn from this college in some form or another, using both silvered words and sharp cunning to inspire their allies and subvert competition. These calculated risk-takers travel the world to make their mark—and their fortune—by navigating treacherous landscapes, economies, and people. With even just a\ncopper to their name, these bards are always worth their weight in gold.3rd-level College of Mercantile feature\nStarting when you join the College of Mercantile at 3rd level, a creature that uses a Bardic Inspiration die from you can choose to forgo rolling the die to flip a coin instead. If it’s heads, the creature treats the Bardic Inspiration die as if it rolled its maximum number. If it’s tails, the GM takes the Bardic Inspiration die and can use it when another creature of the GM’s choice makes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw instead. The GM can have multiple Bardic Inspiration dice at a time in this way, but can still only add one of them to a roll at a time. When you finish a long rest, the GM loses any of these taken Bardic Inspiration dice.3rd-level College of Mercantile feature\nAlso at 3rd level, you know that coins can be just as powerful as the most enthralling rhetoric. Whereas other bards may use words and song as their means for conjuring spells, you instead use a simple coin. You can use any coin worth at least 1 cp as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells.\nIn addition, you can use an action to magically fling a coin from your hand at a target within 60 feet of you.\nMake a ranged spell attack with the coin, using your Charisma modifier for the attack roll. On a hit, the target takes 1 bludgeoning damage plus 1d12 thunder damage. Immediately after the attack, the coin returns to your hand. If you roll a 20 on the attack roll against a hostile creature using a nonmagical copper, silver, electrum, or gold piece, the coin is magically duplicated when it returns to your hand. The new coin can appear in your hand, at your feet, or in a coin pouch on your person (your choice).The coin’s thunder damage increases by 1d12 when you reach 6th level (2d12) and 14th level (3d12).6th-level College of Mercantile feature\nBy 6th level, you’ve learned how to briefly enchant a coin with divination magic. You can enchant a mundane copper, silver, electrum, gold, or platinum piece that you’re holding in this way using an action. A creature holding the coin that knows at least one language can understand the meaning of any word you speak, and when it speaks, you understand what it says. In addition, you have advantage on the first Charisma (Persuasion) check you make when negotiating the value of a good or service with a creature that’s holding or carrying the enchanted coin.Alternatively, you can use an action to see and hear through the enchanted coin until the start of your next turn as if you were in the coin’s space. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses. The coin remains enchanted for 10 minutes or until you end the effect early (no action required). You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma\nmodifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.14th-level College of Mercantile feature\nStarting at 14th level, whenever you cast a spell that consumes a material component, drink a potion, or use a spell scroll that’s worth no more than 500 gp, there is a 50 percent chance that the component, potion, or scroll isn’t consumed. In addition, you can use a bonus action to take the Use an Object action or drink a potion.<br><a href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se?query=tag:RyokosGuideToTheYokaiRealms\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#RyokosGuideToTheYokaiRealms\">#RyokosGuideToTheYokaiRealms</a><br>\n<img alt=\"Bard - College of Hanabi.webp\" src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/classimages/bard-college-of-hanabi.webp\" target=\"_self\">\nSince time immemorial, the College of Hanabi has produced the finest firework artisans. From craftspeople in workshops to conductors who orchestrate thousands of explosions in an intricate performance, bards from this college are celebrated throughout the Yokai Realms. They are more than simple artificers; they imbue each spark with a story, each explosion with emotion, and create an ephemeral tapestry of light and sound whose message moulds the mind of all who witness it.\nWhether or not you attended the college itself or learnt the art from a backstreet alchemist is moot: you are an entertainer who uses bright colours and loud bangs as a medium. Perhaps you travelled with a carnival, bringing joy to a new town each evening. Maybe you are a fresh college graduate, seeking to conduct performances in the courts of the high and mighty. Or perhaps you were employed in the Silk Purse’s quarries, but turned mundane blasting operations into fantastical varicoloured displays, much to the chagrin of your foreman. Naysayers be damned, fireworks are a feast for the eyes, and besides, the explosions aren’t that loud anymore. Maybe you should get that checked out…3rd-Level College of Hanabi Feature\nYour forays into the art of firework creation has granted you the skills of a journeyman craftsperson and experience wielding projectile weapons. You gain proficiency with alchemist’s supplies, one other set of artisan’s tools of your choice, and all magitech firearms. You can use a set of alchemist’s supplies as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells.\nIn addition, when you make an ability check using a tool you have proficiency with, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration. Roll your Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to your ability check. You can choose to do so after you roll the die for the ability check, but before the GM tells you whether you succeed or fail.3rd-Level College of Hanabi Feature\nDuring a long rest, you can create a number of small, magical pyrotechnics equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum one). When you use one of the effects below, you expend one pyrotechnic. You can activate no more than one pyrotechnic per turn. Saving throws are always against your bard spell save DC. Kodama Candle. As a reaction when you are targeted by an attack from a creature you can see within 15 feet of you, you can cause this pyrotechnic to emit a burst of light, imposing disadvantage on the triggering attack roll. A creature that doesn’t rely on sight is immune to this effect. In addition, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of its next turn. Screaming Nue. As an action, you can throw this pyrotechnic to a point within 60 feet of you, where it creates smoke and lights in the form of a screaming nue’s head for the next minute. Each creature other than you within 30 feet of the point that can hear or see the effect must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of it. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself and becoming immune to the effect of any Screaming Nue for the next 24 hours on a success. Raijū’s Rupture. As an action, you can throw this pyrotechnic to a point within 60 feet of you, where it explodes, creating a thundering boom that can be heard for 500 feet. Each creature within 10 feet of the pyrotechnic must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature is deafened until the end of its next turn and takes a number of d6s of thunder damage equal to your proficiency bonus. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t deafened. Wanyūdō Wheel. As a bonus action, you can light this pyrotechnic, which propels you through the air. Until the end of your turn, you gain a flying speed equal to 30 feet plus ten times your proficiency bonus. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks. 6th-Level College of Hanabi Feature\nYour expertise with fireworks lets you craft moving stories capable of influencing peoples’ emotions and outlook.\nOver the course of 1 minute, you can use 10 gp of fireworks to create an enrapturing display of sporadic bright lights and noise audible for 1,000 feet. You must use your action each round to imbue the light and smoke with your bardic magic, causing an enthralling story to manifest; if you fail to do this, the display ends with no effect.\nAt the end of the display, you can choose a number of creatures that witnessed it equal to twice your Charisma modifier (minimum one). Each creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your bard spell save DC or be subject to the effect of the message with which you chose to imbue the display for the next 24 hours. Creatures that do not witness the whole display or that are immune to the charmed condition automatically succeed on this saving throw. Choose one of the following messages: Anger. The message is one of injustice and exploitation, fomenting anger in those that watch it. With a mere spark, riots may ensue. Affected creatures are addled by their anger and prone to violence; Deception checks against them have advantage. Fear. The world is a dangerous place, and to step outside one’s home is to invite disaster. People are unlikely to leave their home, let alone interfere in others’ matters, after watching this performance. Intimidation checks have advantage against an affected creature.\nIn addition, the first time the target sees a creature it can’t identify or with whom it is not acquainted, it must make a Wisdom saving throw against your bard spell save DC. On a failure, the affected creature is frightened of that creature until the unknown creature reveals itself to be non-threatening, or is out of sight. While frightened, an affected target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the condition on itself and becoming immune to being frightened by this effect for the duration. Generosity. The act of giving and gratitude is epitomised as the paradigm of virtue. Observers are more likely to help others after seeing this display. Affected creatures are charmed by you. While charmed, these creatures help you where possible without large risks, and speak highly of your performance. A creature ceases to be charmed if you or your companions do anything harmful to it. Peace. The story shows the utopia that awaits the world if all act with kindness and goodwill. Feelings of resentment are quelled and acts of violence are less likely after a community sees this display. Affected creatures are subject to the calm emotions spell. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.14th-Level College of Hanabi Feature\nYour mastery of the art of hanabi can be seen in even your merest spark. Your Firework Display feature can affect up to three times as many creatures, and your Pyrotechnics are enhanced in the following ways: Kodama Candle. The range increases to 30 feet, and the pyrotechnic sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius until the start of your next turn, causing all attacks against you to have disadvantage. A creature that doesn’t rely on sight is immune to this effect. Screaming Nue. The radius of the effect increases to 40 feet, and creatures that fail the saving throw also take a number of d8s of psychic damage equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded down). Creatures that succeed on the saving throw take half as much damage and aren’t otherwise affected. Raijū’s Rupture. The radius of the explosion increases to 20 feet, and the damage dice increase to d8s. Wanyūdō Wheel. The flying speed granted lasts until the end of your next turn. Your movement does not provoke opportunity attacks for the duration. <br><a href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se?query=tag:RyokosGuideToTheYokaiRealms\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#RyokosGuideToTheYokaiRealms\">#RyokosGuideToTheYokaiRealms</a><br>\n<img alt=\"Bard - College of Masks.webp\" src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/classimages/bard-college-of-masks.webp\" target=\"_self\">\nMasking—the practice of using masks to play a variety of characters in a solo performance—is among the most ancient artistic traditions of the Yokai Realms. Conjuring masks to transform their persona, bards of this college bring tales of fallen heroes, nefarious villains, and epic confrontations to life. Whether on stage or in the heat of battle, such bards perform as a whirling kaleidoscope of character, emotion, and magic, shifting between personas of solitude, war, beauty, and hope. Some bards of this college see their masks as extensions of their true self, a magnification of their power in a specific direction. Others give themselves completely to the transformation, adopting totally fresh outlooks, personas, and even voices depending on the mask they wear. In either case, each mask grants its own special magic, and with the power to switch between them at will, bards of the College of Masks have the tools and talents to seize command of any situation.3rd-Level College of Masks Feature\nYou have the power to conjure magical masks. As a bonus action, you can conjure one mask of your choice from the options below. It appears on your face or levitates in the air around you, and it lasts for 1 minute or until you use a bonus action to dismiss it or conjure another one.\nWhile conjured, your mask grants you advantage on Performance checks, and you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells. The type of mask you conjure also grants an additional benefit:\nMask of Beauty. When a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see makes a saving throw to resist the effects of an enchantment spell you cast, you can use your reaction to expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration, imposing disadvantage on that roll.\nMask of Hope. When a creature within 60 feet of you that can see or hear you rolls a Bardic Inspiration die, you can use your reaction to add your Charisma modifier (minimum of +1) to that roll.\nMask of Solitude. When a creature hits you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to release a blast of force from your mask, dealing 1d8 force damage to the creature and pushing it up to 15 feet away from you.\nMask of War. You can add your Charisma modifier (minimum of +1) to the damage roll of a weapon attack you make or a bard spell you cast (no action required). You can use this benefit once per turn.\nYou can create a mask in this way a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. If you have no uses of this feature remaining, you can create a mask by expending one use of your Bardic Inspiration.\n3rd-Level College of Masks Feature\nYou learn to empower others through the art of performance. If you perform for at least 10 minutes, you can choose a number of creatures up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) who witnessed your performance. Each creature gains temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier + your proficiency bonus (minimum 1 temporary hit point) and has advantage on its next initiative roll before it finishes a long rest. Once you inspire a creature in this way, that creature can’t benefit from this feature again until it finishes a long rest.6th-Level College of Masks Feature\nYour mastery of illusions and trickery grants you the power to move yourself and others through space. While you are on the ground or a surface that can support you, you can use a bonus action to target one creature that is no more than one size larger than you within 60 feet of you. That target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw against your bard spell save DC or you both teleport, swapping places. A creature can choose to fail this saving throw.\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.14th-Level College of Masks Feature\nYour mastery of performance and magic enhances your masks with incredible power. You gain additional benefits depending on the mask you currently have conjured:\nMask of Beauty. You gain a bonus to all saving throws equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of +1).\nMask of Hope. When a creature you can see within 90 feet of you falls to 0 hit points but isn’t killed outright, you can use a reaction to expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration. If you do so, the creature is reduced to 1 hit point instead. Once a creature benefits from this feature, it can’t do so again until it finishes a long rest.\nMask of Solitude. You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.\nMask of War. If you use your action to cast a spell, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action that turn.\n<br><a href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se?query=tag:LArsenesLedger\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#LArsenesLedger\">#LArsenesLedger</a>\nA bard of the College of Mixology considers themselves every bit an artist as any painter or musician. After all, does the playful glint of a glass bottle pirouetting through the air in a perfect arc not compare to a graceful arabesque? Does the exquisite blend of carefully curated flavours not bring to mind the mixing of colours on a canvas? And does the feeling of a gentle buzz not relax the soul like the delicately plucked strings of a harp?\nAdventurous experimenters and eccentric visionaries at heart, mixologists often clash in matters of palate and presentation with bards of the College of Cuisine. These sister colleges maintain a heated rivalry, periodically holding grand competitions that result in meals so sublime, they have been known to make seasoned connoisseurs cry at first taste.3rd-Level College of Mixology Feature\nWith impeccable showmanship and nary a spilled drop, you’ve learned to dazzle audiences by dexterously manipulating your mixology tools. You gain proficiency with brewer’s supplies and can use them as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells. As an action, you can begin a mixological show which lasts up to 1 minute. You must use your action at the start of each of your turns to continue this performance; if you don’t, it ends immediately. When the performance starts, make a Dexterity (brewer's supplies) check. Creatures of your choice within 30 feet of you that can see you whose passive Insight score is lower than the result of your check are distracted by your performance, gaining disadvantage on Perception checks for the duration of the show. If you roll a 1 on the d20, you drop some of your tools and the effect fails to occur. The threshold to drop your tools subsequently increases by 1 each time you make a Dexterity (brewer’s supplies) check using this feature, resetting to 1 when you finish a short or long rest.3rd-Level College of Mixology Feature\nExpertly combining only the finest ingredients, you’ve learned to make delicious beverages that delight even the dourest dwarf. You can use a set of brewer’s supplies to prepare a special cocktail over the course of 1 minute. When you do, select up to two different ingredients from the table below, which you magically conjure to mix the cocktail. A creature can drink a cocktail as an action, gaining the effects of the chosen ingredients, which last for 10 minutes or until the creature drinks another cocktail. A cocktail that isn’t consumed loses its potency when you finish a long rest.You can use this feature to create a cocktail a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.6th-Level College of Mixology Feature\nYou are a seasoned expert at dealing with the inebriated and have a few tricks up your sleeve to make the sober become intoxicated. You have advantage on ability checks made to interact socially with poisoned creatures and, when you make a cocktail with your Pick Your Poison feature, you can overload it with magically potent alcohol instead of choosing ingredients. A creature that drinks this cocktail must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your bard spell save DC or be poisoned for 10 minutes.6th-Level College of Mixology Feature\nPain you as it might, you can rush your creative process to prepare one of your cocktails on the spot. As a bonus action, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to prepare a cocktail with your Pick Your Poison feature, and either drink it or toss it to a willing creature you can see within 30 feet of you, who can immediately use its reaction to drink it.14th-Level College of Mixology Feature\nPresentation matters, and you’ve learned to take your drinks to the next level with some tasteful embellishments, magical replicas of creature parts that you conjure out of thin air. Whenever you make a cocktail with your Pick Your Poison feature, you can select one of the ingredients from the table below as garnish, which provides an additional effect for the cocktail’s duration.Whenever you make a cocktail with a garnish using your Pick Your Poison feature, you can choose to substitute the garnish for an equivalent creature part harvested using the Harvesting rules in Heliana’s Guide to Monster Hunting, and expend a spell slot of 3rd-level or higher in the process. This expends the creature part, but the resulting cocktail doesn’t lose its potency when you finish a long rest. You can have a number of cocktails prepared in this way equal to your Charisma modifier. If making a new one would put you over this limit, the oldest cocktail loses its potency.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#class"],"headers":[{"heading":"Bard

through motions as graceful as any dancer’s, the surging water parting to allow her and her weary companions a peaceful crossing. With patient composure, an oniborne deflects a hail of flaming arrows, redirecting their heat into a cascade of blue flame and burning fists.The clack of jagged obsidian, splash of glacial water, and warmth of flaming eddies gather within a rushing whirlwind. Drifting out of these massed elements is a glowing atatsu; a primordial incarnation of their mortal form.These benders, as disparate as their affinities might be, are defined by their connection with the elements: a magic manifested through precise and practised movements. More than a martial art, their motions are a spectacular union of magical and physical virtuosity, each twist and flick a nuanced touch of the Weave. For some, this is a weapon of war, of thunderclaps and fists of rock. For others, this is a tool to preserve, to craft shields of ice and invigorate with an inner flame. Whether a bender chooses to study all the elements—earth, air, water, and fire—or to master just one, the primordial forces of nature are theirs to command.You can make a bender quickly by following these suggestions. First, put your highest ability score in the ability you choose for your spellcasting: Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma, followed by Dexterity. Second, choose the elementalist background.Hit Dice: 1d8 per bender level\nHit Points at 1st Level: 8 + your Constitution modifier\nHit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per bender level after 1st Armour: Light armour, Medium armour\nWeapons: Simple weapons, chakrams, nunchaku, shortswords, shuriken, starknives, twin blades\nTools: One type of artisan’s tools or one musical instrument of your choice\nSaving Throws: Strength, Constitution\nSkills: Choose two from Acrobatics, Athletics, History, Insight, Religion, and StealthYou start with the following items, in addition to anything provided by your background:\n(a) a quarterstaff, (b) a chakram, or (c) any simple weapon\n(a) a dungeoneer’s pack or (b) an explorer’s pack\nLeather armour and 10 shuriken\nIf you forgo this starting equipment, as well as the items offered by your background, you start with 5d4 x 10 gp to buy your equipment.\nAbility Score Minimum. As a multiclass character, you must have at least a 13 in the spellcasting ability from your bender Spellcasting feature to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already a bender.Proficiencies Gained. If bender isn’t your initial class, when you take your first level as a bender, you gain proficiency with simple weapons.Spell Slots. Add half your levels (rounded up) in the bender class to the appropriate levels from other classes to determine your available spell slots .1st-level Bender feature\nAs a bender of elements, you use the motions of your corporeal form to coax the Weave into manipulating the primordial forces.You know two cantrips of your choice from your bender spell list (see Elemental Affinity) . At higher levels, you learn additional cantrips of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Bender table . Your Elemental Affinity feature also allows you to learn more cantrips at higher levels.The Bender table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your bender spells of 1st level and higher . To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher . You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.You prepare the repertoire of bender spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from your bender spell list (see Elemental Affinity) . When you do so, choose a number of these spells equal to your bender spellcasting ability modifier + half your bender level, rounded down (minimum of one spell) . The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.For example, if you are a 5th-level bender, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots . With a spellcasting ability of 14, your repertoire of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination . If you prepare the 1st-level spell thunderwave, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot . Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your repertoire of prepared spells.You can change your repertoire of prepared spells when you finish a long rest . Preparing a new repertoire of bender spells requires time spent practicing their movements and gestures: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell in your repertoire.When you gain your first level in this class, you choose which spellcasting ability you use for your bender spells from Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. You use this ability whenever a bender spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use this ability’s modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a bender spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your spellcasting ability modifier\nSpell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your spellcasting ability modifierYou can cast a bender spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.You can use your free hand as a spellcasting focus for your bender spells. This free hand can be used for both the somatic and material components for a spell, provided the material component has no cost and isn’t consumed by the casting.Benders induce magical effects through movement. These movements are a precise sequence—similar to the katas practised in karate—and a specific sequence will always result in a specific spell or magical effect. You might describe preparing a spell at the end of a long rest as practising a martial form, or convey a spell not taking effect as its bender slipping on a rock during the sequence. A ritual spell might involve the same sequence being performed repeatedly, each iteration coaxing the elements into the desired effect.When a spell takes effect, it is always linked to the elements in some way. A shield spell cast by a bender with air affinity might appear like tumultuous gusts of wind, while that of an earth bender could condense dust into a rocky plate, or cause a pillar of earth to deflect an incoming blow. A hold person spell could be flavoured as a water bender controlling the water within a person, while a fire bender’s major image could be described as a heat-induced shimmering of the air.1st-Level Bender Feature\nYou find attunement with one of the four elements. Choose one of the following: air, earth, fire, or water. The spells associated with that element (see Bender Spell List on page xx) are added to your bender spell list. Each element is associated with one or two damage types:\nAir: Thunder.\nEarth: Acid &amp; bludgeoning.\nFire: Fire &amp; lightning.\nWater: Cold.\n*At Higher Levels.* At 6th, 10th, and 14th levels, you choose one of the four elements to gain affinity with, either a new element or one you’ve chosen before. This has some immediate effects and interacts with some subclass features (see below).\nNew Elemental Affinity. If you choose a new element with which to gain affinity, you add its spells to your bender spell list and you learn one cantrip of your choice from the new element’s list. This cantrip doesn’t count against the number of cantrips you know.\nRepeated Elemental Affinity. If you choose an element for which you already had affinity, spells that you cast from that spell list are cast one level higher than the level of spell slot you expend. This effect stacks; if you choose to gain affinity with the same element four times, your spells from that element’s list are cast three levels higher than the spell slot you expend.\n1st-Level Bender Feature\nYou have learnt to unite magic with movement, giving you a unique and deadly combat style. When you take the Attack action, you can make melee or ranged spell attacks called elemental strikes as one or more of your attacks. The strike deals damage of a type with which you have affinity (your choice when you make the attack).\nMelee. A melee elemental strike has a reach of 10 feet and deals damage equal to 1d6 plus your bender spellcasting ability modifier on a hit.\nRanged. A ranged elemental strike has a range of 60 feet and deals damage equal to 1d4 plus your bender spellcasting ability modifier on a hit.\nAny magic items that confer a bonus to the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes confer the same bonus to your elemental strikes.2nd-Level Bender Feature\nYour strikes manifest elemental energy, which you can unleash at the peak of your combination. On your turn, after you make a weapon attack or elemental strike, or after you cast a levelled spell from your bender spell list, you can release a jet of elemental energy as a bonus action. Make a spell attack against a creature within 60 feet of you. On a hit, it deals 1d4 damage of a type with which you have affinity. If the target of this attack is within 10 feet of you, you can add your spellcasting ability modifier to the damage.At Higher Levels. This attack's damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 6th level (2d4), 10th level (3d4) and 14th level (4d4) in this class.3rd-Level Bender Feature\nYou choose an aspect of how nature manifests which you embody in your manipulation of the elements. Your discipline choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level.4th-Level Bender Feature\nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.5th-Level Bender Feature\nYou can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.7th-Level Bender Feature\nThis feature replaces the Extra Attack feature and works with features that interact with Extra Attack.You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.When you reach 7th level in this class, your movements allow you to imbue magic in the elements you bend. When you take the Attack action, you can cast one cantrip in the bender spell list that you know in place of one of your attacks. This cantrip must have a casting time of one action, and it is cast at its lowest level.For example, if you are an 11th-level bender and use this feature to replace an attack with a casting of fire bolt, the cantrip deals 1d10 damage (instead of 3d10).11th-Level Bender Feature\nAs a bonus action, you embody aspects of a chosen element. Choose one of the elements with which you have affinity. For 1 minute, you can cast 1st-level spells associated with that element (see Elemental Affinity lists, page xx) without expending a spell slot. In addition, you gain a benefit based on that element:\nAir: Untouchable. You have resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning, slashing, and piercing damage.\nFire: Alight. At the end of your turn, creatures of your choice within 10 feet of you take fire damage equal to your bender spellcasting ability modifier.\nEarth: Solid. You gain a +2 bonus to your AC.\nWater: Fluid. You gain a pool of vitality equal to five times your bender level. At the end of each of your turns for the duration, you can cause up to three creatures of your choice within 10 feet of you to regain 5 hit points (no action required), expending an equal amount of vitality from your pool to do so.\nAfter you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest. Starting at 17th level, while in your primordial form, you can cast spells of 2nd level or lower without expending a spell slot.18th-Level Bender Feature\nAs an action, you become a primordial incarnation of your mortal form. You gain 50 temporary hit points as well as benefits based on your Elemental Affinities, which last for 10 minutes. After you enter this state using this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.<br>Benders control the primordial forces through manipulation of the Weave.

As varied as the myriad ways in which nature manifests, different benders find inspiration from different facets of nature. Some feast on the catastrophic eruption of a volcano, a tumultuous torrent of fire and earth. Others are roused by stoic glaciers and the impenetrable teeth of high mountains. And the bountiful creche of gentle winds and clean water provides succour for those who nurture values of growth and wellbeing.

As varied as the myriad ways in which nature manifests, different benders find inspiration from different facets of nature. Some feast on the catastrophic eruption of a volcano, a tumultuous torrent of fire and earth. Others are roused by stoic glaciers and the impenetrable teeth of high mountains. And the bountiful crèche of gentle winds and clean water provides succour for those who nurture values of growth and wellbeing. At 3rd level, you choose the aspects of nature that inspire your command of the elements.Disciples of Ferocity traverse battlefields as a whirlwind of blades, fists, and elemental fury. Whether it be with the deadly patience of a stalking predator or the reckless abandon of a raging barbarian, these benders rely on an unflinching offence as the solution to that which stands in their way. They are students of devastation. Armed and armoured, their movements embody the destructive forces of nature: desolating wildfires, wrenching tornadoes, surging tsunamis, and rending earthquakes.How did you come to follow such a path? Perhaps you were a mercenary exposed to primordial influences. Maybe you were a sailor, using wind and water to shorten sea voyages and protect your crew from pirates and raiders. Conversely, you may be an acolyte of pacifism, unleashing your destructive potential when fear overrides your better judgement. The choice is yours, and the elements are your weapons.Prerequisite: 3rd-Level Disciple of Ferocity feature\nThe following spells are added to your bender spell list. They always take the form of an element associated with your Elemental Affinity. For example, a guardian of faith may take the form of a giant stalagmite projecting spears of rock (earth affinity), or a storm cloud letting loose booms of thunder (air affinity). Once you gain access to a discipline spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.*The damage type is one for which you have affinity instead of what is specified (you choose when you cast the spell).\n**You move to a Border-Elemental Plane associated with your Elemental Affinity (see page 159).Prerequisite: 3rd-Level Disciple of Ferocity feature\nYou gain proficiency with all martial weapons and can use any weapon you are proficient with as a spellcasting focus for your bender spells.Prerequisite: 3rd-Level Disciple of Ferocity feature\nYou have learnt to channel elemental energy beyond your fist to the weapons you wield. You can use your bender spellcasting ability instead of Strength or Dexterity for weapon attack and damage rolls.Prerequisite: 7th-Level Disciple of Ferocity feature\nWhen you hit a creature with an attack, you can expend a spell slot to deal extra damage of a type associated with your Elemental Affinity. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 6d8.Prerequisite: 15th-Level Disciple of Ferocity feature\nThe damage of your Elemental Combo feature increases to 5d4.Prerequisite: 20th-Level Disciple of Ferocity feature\nYou can attack three times whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.<br><a href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se?query=tag:RyokosGuideToTheYokaiRealms\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#RyokosGuideToTheYokaiRealms\">#RyokosGuideToTheYokaiRealms</a><br>\n<img alt=\"Bender - Disciple of Fusion.webp\" src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/classimages/bender-disciple-of-fusion.webp\" target=\"_self\">\nThe elements are pure: solid earth, liquid water, gaseous air, and fire—energy incarnate. However, the borders between these elements are where things get interesting. Water and earth can produce calamitous mudslides capable of decimating an army. When wind whips up sand, a dust storm can leave even the hardiest explorers lost and disoriented. And, in the calm of a bathhouse, the confluence of fire and water can bring about calming steam that cleanses the body and soothes the soul.\nA bender of the Disciple of Fusion lives on these elemental extremities, pushing the borders, always with an eye on the primordial forces that they have not yet mastered. Your connection to every element runs so deeply that it is almost second nature to blend them together. You may smelt ore with astounding alacrity, be a sculptor whose ability to shape ice rivals that of the finest enkoh architects, or perhaps you work as a thief, creating clouds of smoke to blind guards and make good your escape. You are the unexpected solution that changes the paradigm of any problem.3rd-Level Disciple of Fusion Feature\nYour connection with all elements allows you to mould them in their most basic form. You learn two additional bender cantrips of your choice, which can be from any element’s list, and don’t count towards the number of cantrips you know.3rd-Level Disciple of Fusion Feature\nAs your connection with the primordial forces deepens, you learn to manipulate even the elements with which you are less familiar. You learn one 1st-level bender spell from any element’s list; you always have that spell prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. When you reach 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level in this class, you learn one 2nd-, 3rd-, 4th-, and 5th-level bender spell in this way, respectively.\nIf you don’t have affinity with the element from which a spell is chosen, the spell is cast as if you had 1 affinity with that element.3rd-Level Disciple of Fusion Feature\nWhen you expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher to cast a spell from your bender spell repertoire, you can augment it with another element, creating an additional effect in a sphere centred on the target of your spell or, if the spell affects an area, the centre of the affected area. You choose the size of the sphere, which can have a maximum radius in feet equal to five times the level of the spell slot expended. The effect depends on the element list from which the spell was drawn, and the element with which you choose to combine it. Any saving throws are against your bender spell save DC.\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your bender spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of once), and regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.Air &amp; Earth: Dust. Dust explodes in the sphere. Each creature in the area must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of your next turn.\nAir &amp; Fire: Smoke. Cloying smoke fills the sphere until the end of your next turn. For the duration, the area is heavily obscured, creatures in the area can speak only falteringly, and any creature in the area that tries to cast a spell with a verbal component must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or fail to cast the spell, wasting the spellcasting action (but not the spell slot).\nAir &amp; Water: Ice. All surfaces in the sphere become covered with a layer of slick ice, turning the area into difficult terrain until the end of your next turn. When the ice appears, each creature standing in the area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. A creature that enters the area or ends its turn there must also succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.\nEarth &amp; Fire: Lava. Speckles of molten rock explode in the sphere. Each creature in the area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 fire damage per level of spell slot expended.\nEarth &amp; Water: Mud. A torrent of sticky mud erupts in the sphere. The area becomes difficult terrain until cleaned, and each creature in the sphere has its speed reduced by 15 feet. A creature can use its action to clean the mud off of itself or another affected creature, removing the speed reduction. A creature can clear a 5-foot-square area of difficult terrain as an action.\nFire &amp; Water: Steam. Steam blooms in the sphere until the end of your next turn. For the duration, the area is heavily obscured, and a creature that ends its turn in the sphere takes 1d4 fire damage per level of the spell slot expended.7th-Level Disciple of Fusion Feature\nWhen you cast a spell which deals damage of a type associated with an Elemental Affinity, you can change the damage type to one associated with one of your Elemental Affinities. In addition, when a creature you can see casts a spell that deals damage of a type associated with any Elemental Affinity, you can use your reaction to make a spellcasting ability check. The DC for the check equals 10 plus the spell’s level (cantrips are DC 10). On a success, you change the damage type to one associated with one of your Elemental Affinities.15th-Level Disciple of Fusion Feature\nOn your turn, when you use your action to cast a bender spell of 1st level or higher, you can cast a bender cantrip with a casting time of one action as a bonus action that turn. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your spell bender casting ability modifier (minimum of once) and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.20th-Level Disciple of Fusion Feature<br>\nYou gain two additional Elemental Affinities of your choice, for a total of six affinities. You can have no more than four affinities for any one element. <a data-href=\"Bender#Disciple of Fortification\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/94_character_creation/classes-and-subclasses/bender.html#Disciple_of_Fortification_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Bender &gt; Disciple of Fortification</a><br><a href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se?query=tag:RyokosGuideToTheYokaiRealms\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#RyokosGuideToTheYokaiRealms\">#RyokosGuideToTheYokaiRealms</a><br>\n<img alt=\"00_attachments/ClassImages/Bender - Fortification.webp\" src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/classimages/bender-fortification.webp\" target=\"_self\">\nA bubble of temperate calm amongst a raging wildfire, a wedge of unmoving rock within a landslide, a shield of ice against fist-sized hailstones; you are a bulwark against the forces of nature, bending them to protect yourself and your allies. You understand that your role is not to crush and slaughter, but to preserve those around you so you may triumph together. As a Disciple of Fortification, you may have taken a vow of pacifism yet still yearn for a life of danger and adventure. Perhaps you worked as a bodyguard, valuing the life of another more than your own. Maybe you found employment in a mine, saving colleagues from death by rock and explosives. Or it could be that your self preservation instincts are so well-honed that you cannot help but avoid catastrophe. Either way, the elements shield and fortify you from hurt and harm.3rd-Level Disciple of Fortification Feature\nThe following spells are added to your bender spell list. They always take the form of an element associated with your Elemental Affinity. For example, a shield may appear as ice (water affinity) or rock (earth affinity). Once you gain access to a discipline spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.*See Chapter 13 - Spells\n**Must be a damage type for which you have affinity (see Elemental Affinity, page 159).3rd-Level Disciple of Fortification Feature\nYou gain proficiency with heavy armour and shields. In addition, you can use a shield as a spellcasting focus for your bender spells.3rd-Level Disciple of Fortification Feature\nYou learn to create a shield of primordial energy. As a bonus action on your turn, you can create this shield, granting you or a willing creature within 30 feet of you 1d6 temporary hit points. These temporary hit points last until you use this feature again or the target finishes a long rest. The number of temporary hit points increases to 1d10 at 6th level, 2d6 at 10th level, and 2d10 at 14th level.7th-Level Disciple of Fortification Feature\nWhen a creature you can see within 30 feet of you (including yourself) would take damage of a type associated with your Elemental Affinity (see page 159), you can use your reaction to reduce that damage. The damage is reduced by 2d6 for each time you have chosen affinity with that element. If this reduces the damage to 0, you can make a ranged spell attack, redirecting the energy at a target within 30 feet of the original target. The attack deals damage equal to the amount by which you reduced the triggering damage. The size of these dice increase to d8s at 11th level, d10s at 15th level, and d12s at 20th level.15th-Level Disciple of Fortification Feature\nWhen you cast a bender spell of 1st level or higher, you can choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you (including yourself) to gain a bonus to AC equal to the base level of the spell until the start of your next turn.20th-Level Disciple of Fortification Feature\nWhen you roll initiative and aren’t surprised, you can use your reaction to cast a spell associated with your Elemental Affinity, as shown in the table below, without expending a spell slot.

A precise gust of wind accelerates an arrow over a foe’s shield, striking them in the eye. A burst of flame temporarily blinds an opponent, causing their battleaxe to swing wide. Where others shield and strike, Disciples of Invigoration prefer a more subtle approach, bolstering an ally from within or manipulating a foe’s attacks with alacritous and shrewd bursts of elemental energy. Why did you choose this path? Did you always have a helpful disposition? Were you an aide de camp in a large army? A wizard’s apprentice that wandered into an elemental experiment? Whatever your choice, you are the favourable wind that stops a friend falling, the slick rock that foils a foe’s footing, and the inner flame that turns the tide of battle.3rd-Level Disciple of Invigoration Feature\nThe following spells are added to your bender spell list. They always take the form of an element associated with your Elemental Affinity. For example, the bless spell may manifest as fortuitous gusts of wind (air affinity) or illuminating sparks (fire affinity). Once you gain access to a discipline spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.3rd-Level Disciple of Invigoration Feature\nYour connection to the elements invigorates your body. Your hit point maximum increases by 3 and increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class. In addition, you can add your bender spellcasting ability modifier to checks you make to maintain your concentration.3rd-Level Disciple of Invigoration Feature\nWith shrewd timing, you imbue an ally with invigorating energy. When a willing creature you can see within 30 feet of you fails a saving throw or misses an attack roll, you can use your reaction to give it a rejuvenating boost. It immediately rerolls the saving throw or attack roll, with an additional bonus equal to your bender spellcasting ability modifier, and it must use the new result, potentially turning a failed save into a success or a missed attack into a hit. If this rerolled attack hits, it deals extra damage of a type associated with one of your Elemental Affinities (your choice when you take the reaction) equal to your bender spellcasting ability modifier.You can use this feature a number of times equal to your bender spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of once).

Hunter","icon":"","description":"<img alt=\"Blood Hunter.webp\" src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/classimages/blood-hunter.webp\" target=\"_self\">Marred but resolute, his grimacing face dripping with sweat, a half-orc reddens a finger in the blood of his own wounds, then draws a glowing ruby glyph in the air between him and the bloody behemoth facing him. He grips the weightless sigil, twisting it to unleash streams of dark energy that curse the blood of the monster’s own veins to even the odds.A mysterious half-elf swathed in a worn cloak and rugged leather armor carefully investigates the site of a roadway massacre, her eyes flashing with recognition as she meditates on the remnants of the grisly scene. Suddenly, she jumps to her feet, certain in the knowledge of what creature was responsible, where it can be found—and how little time she has before it kills again.Stepping into lightless chambers filled with ancient dust and lingering whispers, the halfling picks up the warning of imminent danger from the scraping of bone and claw on nearby stone. She winces as she runs her blade across her palm, the steel transmuting blood and essence into glowing runes of powerful magic, eager to brand and burn the flesh of her enemies.Blood hunters are clever warriors driven by an unending determination to destroy evils old and new. Armed with rites of secretive blood magic and a willingness to sacrifice their own vitality and humanity for their cause, they protect the realms from the shadows—even as they remain ever vigilant against being drawn to the darkness that consumes the monsters they hunt.Far from the judging eyes of society, blood hunters have mastered the secretive techniques of hemocraft, finding blood magic’s esoteric nature effective against evils that resist divine rebuke or arcane bindings. Through careful study and practice, blood hunters hone the rites of hemocraft into unique combat techniques, forfeiting a portion of their own health to call blood curses down upon their enemies or summon the elements to aid their strikes. Willing to suffer whatever it takes to achieve victory, these adept warriors have forged themselves into a potent force dedicated to protecting the innocent.Whether driven by the wish to make a difference, the need to take vengeance, or the hope of finding a place to belong in an uncaring world, every blood hunter has their own reasons for undertaking the ritual of the Hunter’s Bane that starts them on this path. In joining an order of blood hunters, one also joins a family bound by service to each other and a common cause. For many, this might be the only family they have left—or have ever known—making the kinship felt between blood hunters an all-but-unbreakable bond.Outside the camaraderie of their orders, however, the life of a blood hunter is not an easy one. The ritual of the Hunter’s Bane can leave a character visibly changed, and prone to unsettling the people around them. Likewise, witnessing hemocraft can invoke superstitious fears from even the most learned scholars. While some cultures have come to accept the good deeds of many blood hunter orders, many blood hunters hide their calling unless absolutely necessary. They feel more comfortable in the wilds and wastes of the world, or drift through the outskirts of society, protecting the poor and defenseless from dark intention and the corrupting touch of fiends.In choosing this path, every blood hunter irrevocably gives a part of themself to their cause—physically, emotionally, and sometimes morally. Each order of blood hunters practices its own ideals and methods, often employing techniques with dark origins that test the strength and will of those who employ them. Many wrestle with the fear of losing this struggle. And so a life of discipline and vigilance drives a blood hunter’s travels as they wander the countryside, in search of like-minded adventurers and whispers of dark deeds afoot.As you create your blood hunter character, think about why you were driven to this lifestyle—and why you strive to give up everything to dwell in the darkness with the evils you hunt. Do you seek a sense of purpose and security, which you found among the order that has taken you in? Have you always carried a seed of darkness within you, so that you look for compatriots who can watch over and prevent you from succumbing to it? Were you once a holy warrior who strayed from your faith and was cast out, even as you yearn to give yourself over to the cause of protecting the innocent?What is your relationship with the powers of hemocraft and the abilities it promises? Do you respect and fear the ancient power that surges through your veins, embracing your gifts and using them freely? Are you worried that this power will eventually turn you into one of the monsters you hunt? Or has your study instilled you with the confident clarity that makes you certain you can control these gifts for the greater good?As well, what made you leave the comfort of your order to strike out on your own? Do you intend to return, or have you decided you have more to learn in the world? What strengths or assets do you seek in other adventurers that can help you meet your goals?Though most blood hunters follow a path of good or neutrality in their pursuits, some have fallen to the dark, seductive side of hemocraft. These blood hunters use their abilities for selfish and evil purposes, often leading to their expulsion from the orders that trained them.<br>You can make a blood hunter quickly by following these suggestions. First, put your highest ability score in Strength or Dexterity, depending on whether you want to focus on melee weapons or on archery (or&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/equipment#Finesse\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/equipment#Finesse\" target=\"_self\">finesse</a>&nbsp;weapons). Your next-highest score should be Intelligence, if you plan to focus on the potency of blood curses and mystical power, or Constitution, if you want to have additional hit points to empower your abilities through sacrifice. Second, choose the&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/backgrounds/soldier\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/backgrounds/soldier\" target=\"_self\">soldier</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/backgrounds/urchin\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/backgrounds/urchin\" target=\"_self\">urchin</a> background.Hit Dice:&nbsp;1d10 per blood hunter level\nHit Points at 1st Level:&nbsp;10 + your Constitution modifier\nHit Points at Higher Levels:&nbsp;1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier per blood hunter level after 1stArmor:&nbsp;Light armor, medium armor, shields\nWeapons:&nbsp;Simple weapons, martial weapons\nTools:&nbsp;Alchemist's supplies\nSaving Throws:&nbsp;Dexterity, Intelligence\nSkills:&nbsp;Choose three from Acrobatics, Arcana, Athletics, History, Insight, Investigation, Religion, and Survival\n(a) a martial weapon or (b) two simple weapons\n(a) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (b) hand crossbow and 20 bolts\n(a) studded leather armor or (b) scale mail armor\nan explorer's pack and alchemist's supplies\n1st-level Blood Hunter feature\nAt 1st level, you have survived the Hunter’s Bane—a dangerous, long-guarded ritual that alters your life’s blood, forever binding you to the darkness and honing your senses against it. You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track fey, fiends, or undead, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about such creatures.The Hunter’s Bane also empowers your body to control and shape hemocraft magic, using your own blood and life essence to fuel your abilities. Some of your features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:Hemocraft save DC&nbsp;= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Hemocraft modifier (your choice between Intelligence and Wisdom)1st-level Blood Hunter feature<br>\nAlso at 1st level, you gain the ability to channel—or sometimes sacrifice—a part of your vital essence to curse and manipulate creatures through hemocraft magic. You know one&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/blood-hunter:blood-curse\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/blood-hunter:blood-curse\" target=\"_self\">Blood Curse</a>&nbsp;of your choice. You learn one additional blood curse of your choice at 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level. Each time you learn a new blood curse, you can also choose one of the blood curses you know and replace it with another blood curse.Each time you use your Blood Maledict feature, you choose which curse to invoke from the curses you know. While invoking a blood curse, but before it affects the target, you can choose to amplify the curse by taking necrotic damage equal to one roll of your hemocraft die. This damage can’t be reduced in any way. An amplified curse gains an additional effect, noted in the curse’s description. Creatures that do not have blood are immune to blood curses unless you have amplified the curse.Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. You can use Blood Maledict twice between rests starting at 6th level, three times starting at 13th level, and four times starting at 17th level.2nd-level Blood Hunter feature\nAt 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.\nArchery.&nbsp;You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.\nDueling.&nbsp;When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.\nGreat Weapon Fighting.&nbsp;When you roll a 1 or 2 on a non-rite damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.\nTwo-Weapon Fighting.&nbsp;When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.\n2nd-level Blood Hunter feature\nAlso at 2nd level, you learn to invoke a rite of hemocraft that infuses your weapon strikes with elemental energy. As a bonus action, you can activate any rite you know on one weapon you’re holding. The effect of the rite lasts until you finish a short or long rest. When you activate a rite, you take necrotic damage equal to one roll of your hemocraft die. This damage can’t be reduced in any way.While the rite is in effect, attacks you make with this weapon are magical, and deal extra damage equal to your hemocraft die of the type determined by the chosen rite. A weapon can hold only one active rite at a time. Other creatures can’t gain the benefit of your rite.You choose one rite from the crimson rites below when you first gain this feature. You learn an additional crimson rite at 7th level, and again at 14th level.Rite of the Flame.&nbsp;Your rite damage is fire damage.\nRite of the Frozen.&nbsp;Your rite damage is cold damage.\nRite of the Storm.&nbsp;Your rite damage is lightning damage.\nRite of the Dead.&nbsp;Your rite damage is necrotic damage. (Prerequisite: 14th level)\nRite of the Oracle.&nbsp;Your rite damage is psychic damage. (Prerequisite: 14th level)\nRite of the Roar.&nbsp;Your rite damage is thunder damage. (Prerequisite: 14th level)3rd-level Blood Hunter feature\nAt 3rd level, you commit to an order of blood hunters whose philosophy will guide you throughout your life. The order you choose grants you features at 3rd level, and again at 7th, 11th, 15th, and 18th level.4th-level Blood Hunter feature\nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.5th-level Blood Hunter feature\nStarting at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.6th-level Blood Hunter feature\nAt 6th level, when you damage a creature with a weapon for which you have an active crimson rite, you can channel hemocraft magic to sear an arcane brand into that creature (no action required). You always know the direction to the branded creature as long as it’s on the same plane as you. Further, each time the branded creature deals damage to you or a creature you can see within 5 feet of you, the branded creature takes psychic damage equal to your Hemocraft modifier (minimum of 1).<br>Your brand lasts until you dismiss it or until you use this feature to apply a brand to another creature. Your brand can be dispelled with&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:dispel-magic\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:dispel-magic\" target=\"_self\">Dispel Magic</a>, and is treated as a spell with a level equal to half your blood hunter level (maximum 9th level).Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.9th-level Blood Hunter feature\nWhen you reach 9th level, you gain a supernatural talent for discerning the secrets surrounding mysterious relics or places touched by evil. Whenever you make an Intelligence (History) check to recall information about the sinister or tragic history of an object you are touching or your current location, you have advantage on the check. At the DM’s discretion, a suitably high roll might cause your character to experience brief visions of the past connected to the object or location.10th-level Blood Hunter feature\nStarting at 10th level, the magic of hemocraft suffuses your body to permanently reinforce your resilience. Your speed increases by 5 feet, and you have a bonus to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws equal to your Hemocraft modifier (minimum of +1).13th-level Blood Hunter feature\nStarting at 13th level, the psychic damage from your Brand of Castigation increases to twice your Hemocraft modifier (minimum of 2). Additionally, a branded creature can’t take the Dash action, and if it attempts to teleport or to leave its current plane by any means, it takes 4d6 psychic damage and must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the attempt to teleport or leave the plane fails.14th-level Blood Hunter feature\nWhen you reach 14th level, you have advantage on saving throws against being charmed and frightened.20th-level Blood Hunter feature\nUpon reaching 20th level, your mastery of blood magic reaches its height, mitigating your sacrifice and empowering your expertise. Once per turn, whenever a blood hunter feature requires you to roll a hemocraft die, you can reroll the die and use either roll.Additionally, whenever you score a critical hit with a weapon for which you have an active crimson rite, you regain one expended use of your Blood Maledict feature.The Order of the Ghostslayer is the oldest of the blood hunter orders, its members having originally rediscovered the secrets of hemocraft and refined them for combat against the scourge of undeath. Ghostslayers seek out and study the moment of death, obsessing over the mystery of the transition from life, and the unholy power that can cause the dead to rise once more. These zealous blood hunters make it their life’s work to destroy the scourge of undeath wherever it is found, tuning their abilities to engage undead creatures and those who manipulate the necromancy that creates them.When you join this order at 3rd level, you learn the Rite of the Dawn as part of your Crimson Rite feature. When you activate the Rite of the Dawn, the extra damage dealt by your rite is radiant damage. Additionally, while that rite is active on your weapon, you gain the following benefits:\nYour weapon sheds bright light out to a radius of 20 feet.\nYou have resistance to necrotic damage.\nWhen you hit an undead creature with a weapon for which the Rite of the Dawn is active, you roll an additional hemocraft die when determining the extra damage from the rite.\n3rd-level Order of the Ghostslayer feature\nStarting at 3rd level, you learn to master blood curses. You gain an additional use of your Blood Maledict feature. In addition, your blood curses can target any creature, whether it has blood or not.7th-level Order of the Ghostslayer feature\nUpon reaching 7th level, at the start of your turn, you can magically step into the veil between the planes as long as you aren’t incapacitated. You can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain, as well as see and affect creatures and objects on the Ethereal Plane. You take 1d10 force damage if you end your turn inside an object.This feature lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Hemocraft modifier (minimum of 1 round). If you are inside an object when it ends, you are immediately shunted to the nearest unoccupied space and you take force damage equal to twice the number of feet you moved.Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. You can use Aether Walk twice between rests starting at 15th level.11th-level Order of the Ghostslayer feature\nStarting at 11th level, your Brand of Castigation exposes a fragment of your foe’s essence, leaving them vulnerable to your Crimson Rite feature. Whenever you hit a creature with a weapon for which you have an active crimson rite, you roll an additional hemocraft die when determining the extra damage from the rite. Additionally, if a branded creature has the Incorporeal Movement trait or a similar feature, it can’t move through creatures or objects while branded.15th-level Order of the Ghostslayer feature<br>\nAt 15th level, you hone your hemocraft to tear corruption from the minds and bodies of your allies — and to punish those responsible for it. You gain the&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/blood-hunter:blood-curse#toc4\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/blood-hunter:blood-curse#toc4\" target=\"_self\">Blood Curse of the Exorcist</a>&nbsp;for your Blood Maledict feature. This doesn’t count against your number of blood curses known.18th-level Order of the Ghostslayer feature\nUpon reaching 18th level, you learn to protect your fading life by reabsorbing the energy you feed to your weapons. If you have one or more crimson rites active and you are reduced to 0 hit points but don’t die outright, you can choose to have all your active crimson rites end and drop to 1 hit point instead.The ancient curse of lycanthropy is feared by nearly all peoples and cultures, passed through blood and seeding a host with the savage strength and hunger for violence of a wicked beast. The Order of the Lycan is a proud group of blood hunters who undergo “the Taming” — the ceremonial infliction of lycanthropy by a senior member of the order, for those who do not already carry the curse before seeking this path. These hunters then use the magic of their blood to harness the power of the monster they harbor, without losing themselves to it. Using intense will and secret blood magic rituals, members of the Order of the Lycan learn to control and unleash their hybrid forms for short periods of time. Enhanced physical prowess, unnatural resilience, and razor-sharp claws make these warriors a terrible foe to any evil that crosses their path. Yet no training is perfect, and without care and complete focus, even the greatest of blood hunters can temporarily lose themselves to their own hunger.3rd-level Order of the Lycan feature\nWhen you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the improved senses of a natural predator. You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.3rd-level Order of the Lycan feature\nAlso at 3rd level, you learn to control the lycanthropic curse that courses through your veins. As a bonus action, you transform into a special hybrid form for up to 1 hour. You can speak, use equipment, and wear armor while in this form, and can revert to your normal form as a bonus action. You automatically revert to your normal form if you fall unconscious or die.This feature replaces the rules for lycanthropy in the Monster Manual. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. While you are transformed, you gain the following features:\nFeral Might.&nbsp;You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws, and you have a +1 bonus to melee damage rolls. This bonus increases to +2 at 11th level and to +3 at 18th level.\nResilient Hide.&nbsp;You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks not made with silvered weapons. Additionally, while you are not wearing heavy armor, you have a +1 bonus to AC.\nPredatory Strikes.&nbsp;You can apply your Crimson Rite feature to your unarmed strikes, which you treat as one weapon. You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes, which deal 1d6 bludgeoning or slashing damage (your choice). This damage increases to 1d8 at 11th level. Additionally, when you use the Attack action to make an unarmed strike, you can make one additional unarmed strike as a bonus action. Bloodlust.&nbsp;If you start your turn with fewer hit points than half your hit point maximum, you must succeed on a DC 8 Wisdom saving throw or move directly toward the nearest creature and use the Attack action against that creature. If you’re concentrating on a spell or are under an effect that prevents you from concentrating (such as the barbarian’s Rage feature), you automatically fail this saving throw. If you have your Extra Attack feature, you can choose whether to use it for this frenzied attack. If more than one creature is equally near to you, roll randomly to determine your target. Once your attack is resolved, you regain control of yourself. 7th-level Order of the Lycan feature\nAt 7th level, your speed increases by 10 feet, and you add 10 feet to your long jump distance and 3 feet to your high jump distance. Your hybrid form also gains the following additional benefit.\nImproved Predatory Strikes.&nbsp;You have a +1 bonus to attack rolls made with your unarmed strike. This bonus increases to +2 at 11th level and to +3 at 18th level. Additionally, when you have an active crimson rite on your unarmed strike while in your hybrid form, your unarmed strikes are considered magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.\n11th-level Order of the Lycan feature\nAt 11th level, you learn to unleash and control more of the beast within. You can use your Hybrid Transformation feature twice, regaining all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest. Your hybrid form also gains the following additional benefit.\nLycan Regeneration.&nbsp;At the start of each of your turns when you have at least 1 hit point but fewer hit points than half your hit point maximum, you gain hit points equal to 1 + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1). If you are in hybrid form, you gain these hit points before you must make the saving throw for your bloodlust.\n15th-level Order of the Lycan feature\nStarting at 15th level, you have advantage on the saving throw for your bloodlust while in hybrid form. Additionally, your Brand of Castigation can now bind a foe to your hunter’s ferocity. While in your hybrid form, you have advantage on attack rolls against a creature branded by you.18th-level Order of the Lycan feature\nAt 18th level, you have mastered your inner predator. You can use your Hybrid Transformation feature an unlimited number of times, and your hybrid form lasts until you revert to your normal form, fall unconscious, or die.<br>You also gain the&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/blood-hunter:blood-curse#toc8\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/blood-hunter:blood-curse#toc8\" target=\"_self\">Blood Curse of the Howl</a>&nbsp;for your Blood Maledict feature. This doesn’t count against your number of blood curses known.The process of undertaking the Hunter’s Bane ritual is a painful, scarring, and sometimes fatal experience. Those who survive are irrevocably changed — and not always for the better. Over generations of experimentation, a splinter order of blood hunters honed the way in which hemocraft alters the body, using corrupted alchemy and toxic elixirs to alter their blood even further. Over time, they have modified their capabilities in battle, becoming something beyond what they once were. Calling themselves the Order of the Mutant, these blood hunters now specialize in assessing the strengths and weaknesses of their foes, altering their biology to be best prepared for any conflict.3rd-level Order of the Mutant feature\nWhen you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn to master forbidden alchemical formulas—known as mutagens—that can temporarily alter your mental and physical abilities.As a bonus action, you consume a mutagen, whose effects and side effects last until you finish a short or long rest unless otherwise specified. While one or more mutagens are affecting you, you can use an action to focus and flush all mutagens from your system, ending their effects and side effects.Mutagens are designed for the specific biology of the character who concocted them, and your mutagens have no effect on other creatures. They are also unstable by nature, losing their potency over time and becoming inert if not used before you finish your next short or long rest.<br>The number of mutagens you can concoct when you finish a rest, and the number of formulas you know, increases as you gain levels in the blood hunter class, as shown on the Mutagencraft table above. Additionally, when you learn a new mutagen formula, you can replace one formula you already know with a new mutagen formula. You choose four&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/blood-hunter:mutagens\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/blood-hunter:mutagens\" target=\"_self\">mutagen formulas</a>&nbsp;to learn, and you can concoct one mutagen when you finish a short or long rest.7th-level Order of the Mutant feature\nWhen you reach 7th level, your body begins to adapt to toxins and venoms, ignoring their corrupting effects. You gain immunity to poison damage and the poisoned condition.Additionally, you can trigger a burst of adrenaline that lets you temporarily resist the negative effects of a mutagen. As a bonus action, you can ignore the negative side effect of one mutagen affecting you for 1 minute. Once you do so, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.11th-level Order of the Mutant feature<br>\nAt 11th level, your mutagenic hemocraft lets your Brand of Castigation reveal a foe’s true nature. Any illusion or invisibility in effect on a creature when you brand it ends, and the creature can’t benefit from invisibility or illusion effects while branded by you. If a creature branded by you is in an alternative form (by way of the&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:polymorph\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:polymorph\" target=\"_self\">Polymorph</a>&nbsp;spell, the Change Shape action or Shapechanger trait, the Wild Shape feature, and similar effects), it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or revert to its true form and be stunned until the end of your next turn. Whenever a branded creature attempts to alter its form, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the attempt fail, and it is stunned until the end of your next turn.15th-level Order of the Mutant feature<br>\nStarting at 15th level, your blood curse can infuse a creature’s body with terrible toxins. You gain the&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/blood-hunter:blood-curse#toc3\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/blood-hunter:blood-curse#toc3\" target=\"_self\">Blood Curse of Corrosion</a>&nbsp;for your Blood Maledict feature. This doesn’t count against your number of blood curses known.18th-level Order of the Mutant feature\nAt 18th level, your body has adapted to produce mutagens naturally in a moment of need. As a bonus action, choose one mutagen currently affecting you. Its effects and side effects end, and you can immediately have a mutagen you know the formula for take effect in its place.You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Hemocraft modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.Blood hunters belonging to the Order of the Profane Soul have pushed the limits of hemocraft for use against some of the most terrifying creatures corrupting the world. Ancient fiends and cruel magic-users have long counted on their ability to meld into the background and escape those who hunt them, vanishing into noble courts without a trace, or bending the minds of the most stalwart warriors with but a glance. So the blood hunters who founded this order trusted to their resilience as they delved into the same well of corrupting arcane knowledge, making pacts with lesser evils to better combat the greater threats. And though they might have traded a part of themselves for their power, the members of this order know the benefits of that power far outweigh the price.3rd-level Order of the Profane Soul Feature\nWhen you reach 3rd level, you strike a bargain with an otherworldly being of your choice:The choice you make augments some of your subclass features, as noted below.3rd-level Order of the Profane Soul feature<br>\nWhen you reach 3rd level, you can augment your combat techniques with the ability to cast spells.

You learn an additional warlock cantrip of your choice at 10th level.Spell Slots.&nbsp;The Profane Soul Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.<br>For example, when you are 8th level, you have two 2nd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:witch-bolt\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:witch-bolt\" target=\"_self\">Witch Bolt</a>, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 2nd-level spell.Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher.&nbsp;At 3rd level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list.The Spells Known column of the Profane Soul Spellcasting table shows when you learn more warlock spells of your choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 13th level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.Spellcasting Ability.&nbsp;Your chosen Hemocraft ability (Intelligence or Wisdom) is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Hemocraft ability whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Hemocraft modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.Spell save DC&nbsp;= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Hemocraft modifier.\nSpell attack modifier&nbsp;= your proficiency bonus + your Hemocraft modifier.3rd-level Order of the Profane Soul feature\nStarting at 3rd level, your weapon becomes a conduit for the power of your pact with your chosen patron. While you have an active crimson rite, you can use your weapon as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells, and you gain a specific benefit based on your chosen pact.The Archfey.&nbsp;When you damage a creature with a weapon for which you have an active crimson rite, that creature glows with faint light until the end of your next turn. For the duration, the creature gains no benefit from any cover or from being invisible.The Celestial.&nbsp;As a bonus action, you expend one use of your Blood Maledict feature to heal one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature regains a number of hit points equal to one roll of your hemocraft die + your Hemocraft modifier (minimum of +1).The Fathomless.&nbsp;You can breathe underwater. Additionally, once per turn when you damage a creature with a weapon for which you have an active crimson rite, you can reduce that creature’s speed by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.The Fiend.&nbsp;While using the Rite of the Flame, if you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die when you roll the extra damage from the rite, you can reroll the die and choose which roll to use.The Genie.&nbsp;As a bonus action, you expend a use of your Blood Maledict feature to give yourself a flying speed of 30 feet, which lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Hemocraft modifier (minimum of 1 round).The Great Old One.&nbsp;When you score a critical hit against a creature, that creature and any other creatures of your choice within 10 feet of it are frightened of you until the end of your next turn.The Hexblade.&nbsp;When you successfully target a creature with a blood curse, the next time you hit that creature with an attack while the curse is in effect, the attack deals additional damage equal to your proficiency modifier.The Undead.&nbsp;When you take necrotic damage, you can use your reaction to halve that damage. In addition, your appearance changes to reflect some aspect of your patron while you have any crimson rite active.The Undying.&nbsp;When you reduce a hostile creature of at least mild threat (DM’s discretion) to 0 hit points, you regain a number of hit points equal to one roll of your hemocraft die.7th-level Order of the Profane Soul feature\nStarting at 7th level, when you use your action to cast a cantrip, you can immediately make one weapon attack as a bonus action.7th-level Order of the Profane Soul feature\nAt 7th level, your patron grants you the use of a distinctive spell based on your pact.

As varied as the gods they serve, clerics strive to embody the handiwork of their deities. No ordinary priest, a cleric is imbued with divine magic.Arms and eyes upraised toward the sun and a prayer on his lips, an elf begins to glow with an inner light that spills out to heal his battle-worn companions.Chanting a song of glory, a dwarf swings his axe in wide swaths to cut through the ranks of orcs arrayed against him, shouting praise to the gods with every foe’s fall.Calling down a curse upon the forces of undeath, a human lifts her holy symbol as light pours from it to drive back the zombies crowding in on her companions.Clerics are intermediaries between the mortal world and the distant planes of the gods. As varied as the gods they serve, clerics strive to embody the handiwork of their deities. No ordinary priest, a cleric is imbued with divine magic.Divine magic, as the name suggests, is the power of the gods, flowing from them into the world. Clerics are conduits for that power, manifesting it as miraculous effects. The gods don’t grant this power to everyone who seeks it, but only to those chosen to fulfill a high calling.Harnessing divine magic doesn’t rely on study or training. A cleric might learn formulaic prayers and ancient rites, but the ability to cast cleric spells relies on devotion and an intuitive sense of a deity’s wishes.Clerics combine the helpful magic of healing and inspiring their allies with spells that harm and hinder foes. They can provoke awe and dread, lay curses of plague or poison, and even call down flames from heaven to consume their enemies. For those evildoers who will benefit most from a mace to the head, clerics depend on their combat training to let them wade into melee with the power of the gods on their side.Not every acolyte or officiant at a temple or shrine is a cleric. Some priests are called to a simple life of temple service, carrying out their gods’ will through prayer and sacrifice, not by magic and strength of arms. In some cities, priesthood amounts to a political office, viewed as a stepping stone to higher positions of authority and involving no communion with a god at all. True clerics are rare in most hierarchies.When a cleric takes up an adventuring life, it is usually because his or her god demands it. Pursuing the goals of the gods often involves braving dangers in unsettled lands, smiting evil, or seeking holy relics in ancient tombs. Many clerics are also expected to protect their deities’ worshipers, which can mean fighting enemy raiders, negotiating peace between warring nations, or sealing a portal that would allow a demon prince to enter the world.Most adventuring clerics maintain some connection to established temples and orders of their faiths. A temple might ask for a cleric’s aid, or a high priest might be in a position to demand it.<br>As you create a cleric, the most important question to consider is which deity to serve and what principles you want your character to embody.

Check with your DM to learn which deities are in your campaign.Once you’ve chosen a deity, consider your cleric’s relationship to that god. Did you enter this service willingly? Or did the god choose you, impelling you into service with no regard for your wishes? How do the temple priests of your faith regard you: as a champion or a troublemaker? What are your ultimate goals? Does your deity have a special task in mind for you? Or are you striving to prove yourself worthy of a great quest?You can make a cleric quickly by following these suggestions. First, Wisdom should be your highest ability score, followed by Strength or Constitution. Second, choose the acolyte background.Hit Dice:&nbsp;1d8 per cleric level\nHit Points at 1st Level:&nbsp;8 + your Constitution modifier\nHit Points at Higher Levels:&nbsp;1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per cleric level after 1stArmor:&nbsp;Light armor, medium armor, shields\nWeapons:&nbsp;All simple weapons\nTools:&nbsp;None\nSaving Throws:&nbsp;Wisdom, Charisma\nSkills:&nbsp;Choose two from History, Insight, Medicine, Persuasion, and ReligionYou start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:\n(a) a mace or (b) a warhammer (if proficient)\n(a) scale mail, (b) leather armor, or (c) chain mail (if proficient)\n(a) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (b) any simple weapon\n(a) a priest's pack or (b) an explorer's pack\nA shield and a holy symbol\nAs a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric spells.1st-level Cleric feature<br>\nAt 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spells:cleric\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spells:cleric\" target=\"_self\">cleric spell list</a>. You learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cleric table.The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your cleric spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.<br>For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination.

Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.Spell save DC&nbsp;= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier\nSpell attack modifier&nbsp;= your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifierYou can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.You can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.1st-level Cleric feature\nAt 1st level, you choose a domain shaped by your choice of Deity and the gifts they grant you. Your choice grants you domain spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels.Each domain has a list of spells-its domain spells that you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.If you have a domain spell that doesn't appear on the cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.2nd-level Cleric feature\nAt 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description.When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save DC.Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.2nd-level Cleric feature\nAt 2nd level, you can expend a use of your Channel Divinity to fuel your spells. As a bonus action, you touch your holy symbol, utter a prayer, and regain one expended spell slot, the level of which can be no higher than half your proficiency bonus (rounded up). The number of times you can use this feature is based on the level you've reached in this class: 2nd level, once; 6th level, twice; and 18th level, thrice. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.4th-level Cleric feature\nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.

When a creature takes damage from one of your cantrips or weapon attacks, you can also deal 1d8 radiant damage to that creature. Once you deal this damage, you can't use this feature again until the start of your next turn.10th-level Cleric feature\nBeginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is great.Imploring your deity's aid requires you to use your action. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your cleric level, your deity intervenes. The DM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any cleric spell or cleric domain spell would be appropriate. If your deity intervenes, you can't use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest.At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required.<br><a href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se?query=tag:TheGriffonsSaddlebag_BookOne\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#TheGriffonsSaddlebag_BookOne\">#TheGriffonsSaddlebag_BookOne</a><br>\n<img alt=\"00_attachments/ClassImages/Cleric - Astral.webp\" src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/classimages/cleric-astral.webp\" target=\"_self\">\nAs adventurers explore the multiverse, new pantheons are created to explain the otherwise inexplicable. Gods and demigods offer their wisdom to followers brave enough to believe in them. Their power grows with each new believer, and as people continue to look for answers, these new deities will continue to be there to answer the call.You may be led to follow such a god. Whether your path is one of piety or reverence, no two adventurers will have the same relationship with their domain.Gods of the Astral Plane are as lost to time and space as the realm they reign over. The Astral Plane fills the gaps between the planes of existence and is an important, balancing force in the cosmic ecosystem of the multiverse. Practitioners of this domain see the absence of anything as something, and consider the Astral Plane as the ultimate destination of all things. These acolytes follow the ultimate path to their destination, and help shepherd others along their way in a grand mission of entropy. Clerics of the astral domain are chaotic by nature, but typically choose to destroy evil where they find it and hasten its inevitable journey to the Astral Plane.You gain domain spells at the cleric levels listed in the Astral Domain Spells table. See the Divine Domain class feature for how domain spells work.1st-level Astral Domain Feature\nWhen you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain the guidance cantrip if you don’t already know it.1st-level Astral Domain Feature\nAt 1st level, you can create and reach through brief holes in the fabric of reality. When you cast a spell that has a range of touch, you can target a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see instead. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.2nd-level Astral Domain Feature\nStarting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to create a brief tear in the planar fabric that leads to the Astral Plane. As a bonus action, you can point your finger at a point you can see within 60 feet to create a planar tear. The tear is minuscule, but creates a powerful vacuum that forces each creature within 15 feet of the point to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes force damage equal to 2d10 + half your cleric level and is pulled up to 15 feet toward the point. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much force damage and is not pulled. The tear vanishes immediately after drawing in any nearby creatures.6th-level Astral Domain Feature\nBy 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to distort the fabric of reality. As an action, you teleport up to 30 feet away to an unoccupied space you can see. Alternatively, you can choose a space within range that is occupied by a Small or Medium creature. If that creature is willing, you both teleport, swapping places.8th-level Astral Domain Feature\nStarting at 8th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.17th-level Astral Domain Feature\nAt 17th level, you can choose to target a hostile creature when you use your Spatial Exchange feature. When you do, that creature must make a Charisma saving throw against your cleric spell save DC. On a failure, it switches places with you. On a success, neither you nor the creature are moved by your Channel Divinity.In addition, your comfort slipping through planes allows you to do more while you move between them. Whenever you successfully swap places with another creature using your Spatial Exchange feature, you can cast a spell of 5th level or lower with a range of touch as part of that action. The spell must have a casting time of 1 action, and you must target the creature you’re switching places with.

These miraculous spells are capable of helping friends and harming foes, calling forth healing arias and radiant flames alike. Not all who are devoted to the gods are capable of achieving such feats, as these powers are reserved for only those chosen to fulfill a greater purpose. As a result, clerics rely on their connection to a deity rather than years of rigorous study. Fueled by divine purpose, clerics depend on a mixture of combat training and heavenly magic to thwart the forces that resist the will of their deity.Gods of eating and drinking, such as Daghdha or Dionysus, promote the value of a good meal as much as they do the joy of sharing it with friends. As a follower of thisdomain, you believe that a good feast can be enough to settle most wars. You may know this first-hand: perhaps your life has been marred by poverty and survival with spoiled scraps, or maybe you’ve been blessed with lovingly-cooked meals and the joy of a full stomach. Regardless of your origins, you recognize the magic of a good meal and the power it has on a person’s spirit and well-being.\nThrough your passion and devotion, you see mealtime as a joyous way to worship the magic of food and your chosen deity. You are a capable chef with an appreciation of all food, both good and bad. You know that a foul meal can turn even the most veteran of stomachs against themselves, and have learned to harness this power for yourself. Like food, most people will like you at your best, but everyone will fear you at your worst.You gain domain spells at the cleric levels listed in the Festus Domain Spells table.

When a creature within 5 feet of you that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to cause the creature to make a Constitution saving throw against your cleric spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d12 poison damage and is poisoned until the end of its next turn. On a successful one, it takes half as much poison damage and isn’t poisoned.You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.2nd-level Festus Domain feature\nStarting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity as an action to create a small and magically concentrated potion called a healing draft. The potion appears in a small glass bottle in your free hand or at your feet (your choice), and is a deep blue color with flecks of gold. A creature that uses a bonus action to drink this potion regains a number of hit points equal to 2d6 + your cleric level. The bottle and any undrunk healing draft turns to dust and is lost when you finish a short or long rest.6th-level Festus Domain feature\nStarting at 6th level, your divinity and magically enhanced constitution have strengthened your natural defenses. You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance to acid and poison damage.In addition, whenever you cast the create food and water spell, the food tastes delicious, and you can choose to replace up to 5 gallons of the water created by the spell with ale or wine.

Shrine Warden clerics celebrate and honour the deities they follow through the creation and preservation of hallowed sites in their honour—consecrated ground where the misty division between spiritual and physical melts away to nothing. To such clerics, power can be drawn from almost any kaiju, spirit, deity, or pantheon they worship. For the Shrine Warden, the act of devotion itself is magical, and the erection of a shrine a beacon of hope to those in need, and of terror to those who mean it harm.*See Chapter 13 - Spells1st-Level Shrine Warden Domain Feature\nYou gain proficiency with martial weapons and heavy armour.1st-Level Shrine Warden Domain Feature\nOnce per turn, when you hit a creature with an attack roll, you can attempt to expel or trap the creature.

Clerics of these gods might bless nobles before a hunt, work as mercenaries tracking dangerous monsters through the wilderness, or be employed as scouts within armies. They are adept at finding their prey and, once located, use their magic to ensure they are never outrun.

Indeed, tales abound of clerics of Festivity infiltrating fortified citadels under siege, instigating exuberant carousing, and leaving their fellow merrymakers collapsed and exhausted after expending every last iota of energy. It is then a simple task for a waiting army to enter the city and lock their fatigued foes in chains.

src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/classimages/druid-unbroken-circle.webp\" target=\"_self\">\nFrom all walks of life come new ecosystems. Nature is limitless, and over time will successfully conquer any challenge set before it. So too are the druids dedicated to protecting it.Through foggy glens, icy crags, or molten wastelands, druids across the world will always seek to defend nature and destroy the forces that seek to oppress it. As diverse as the land, druids develop their own methodology, traditions, and druidic circles over generations.The Unbroken Circle is an order of druids who have abandoned the patient teachings of their predecessors, deciding instead to take up arms in defense of the wilderness. These combative druids form militias and harness the fury of nature itself to forcefully remove any encroaching evil that threatens their sacred lands.While the chaotic bend of nature is found within these druids, their bodies and impulses are tamed through training and discipline. Originally from the unforgiving Festerwood, this circle’s teachings are as rigorous as the forest, blending a mixture of offense and defense to stand up to all of the world’s challenges.2nd-level Unbroken Circle Feature\nWhen you choose this circle at 2nd level, you gain proficiency with martial weapons. In addition, you learn the shillelagh cantrip. If you already know this cantrip, you learn a different druid cantrip of your choice. The cantrip doesn’t count against your number of cantrips known.When you cast shillelagh, you can use it to imbue any melee weapon you’re holding with nature’s power. If you’re holding a weapon under the effects of shillelagh, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.2nd-level Unbroken Circle Feature\nAt 2nd level, you gain the ability to recover using the wild, bestial magic that courses through you. As a bonus action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape to regain a number of hit points equal to 1d10 + your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1). When you reach 10th level in this class, you regain 2d10 + your Wisdom modifier instead.6th-level Unbroken Circle Feature\nStarting at 6th level, when you cast shillelagh, the weapon’s damage die becomes a d10, instead of a d8. When you reach 14th level in this class, the damage die becomes a d12.\nIn addition, while you’re wielding a weapon under the effects of shillelagh, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn using&nbsp; that weapon. 10th-level Unbroken Circle Feature\nAt 10th level, when you use your action to cast a druid cantrip, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.14th-level Unbroken Circle Feature\nBy 14th level, your connection to nature helps to shield&nbsp; you from harm. At the start of each of your turns, you&nbsp;gain a number of temporary hit points equal to half your druid level.<br><a href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se?query=tag:TheGriffonsSaddlebag_BookTwo\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#TheGriffonsSaddlebag_BookTwo\">#TheGriffonsSaddlebag_BookTwo</a><br>\n<img alt=\"Druid - Circle of Dragons.webp\" src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/classimages/druid-circle-of-dragons.webp\" target=\"_self\">\nChanneling their inner connection to the earth in order to control powerful spells and magic abilities, druids are the wardens of the natural world. Valuing the needs of all living things against their own, these primal mages are likely to feel out of place when joining the rest of civilization. However, when the balance of the natural world is at stake, nothing can quell a druid’s determination and ferocity, rushing to thwart the efforts of evil and the unnatural—especially aberrations and undead.The Circle of Dragons is an old order of druids steeped in rigid tradition. These honor-bound wardens of nature and draconic heritage are members of a secret society that have influenced governance, war, and culture across the world. High-standing members of this Circle have ties to royal bloodlines that date back generations, a connection that’s subtly showcased in royal family crests and insignia.2nd-level Circle of Dragons feature\nStarting at 2nd level, you can speak, read, and write Draconic. Additionally, whenever you make an\nIntelligence (History) check related to draconic history or lore, you can add your proficiency bonus to the check. If you are already proficient in the History skill, you can add double your proficiency bonus to the check instead.2nd-level Circle of Dragons featureAt 2nd level, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature as a bonus action to transform into a unique form: your dragon shape. You become a Medium dragon while in this form, standing on all fours, but retain your normal character statistics and senses. Your dragon shape’s AC is equal to 13 + your Dexterity modifier (maximum 2) and has a walking speed and climbing speed of 30 feet. In addition, when you take this form, you gain temporary hit points equal to your hit point maximum.When you return to your normal form, you lose any remaining temporary hit points. You can remain in this form for a number of hours equal to half your druid level, rounded down. You can\nrevert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.When you use your dragon shape, you determine what type of dragon to transform into. The type of dragon determines your scale color and breath weapon’s damage type, as shown in the table below, but your appearance is otherwise up to you. Your wings aren’t yet fully formed at 2nd level, but grow stronger as you gain levels in this class.You can’t cast spells while in this form, but gain a different set of actions you can use on each of your turns:\nBite. When you take the Attack action, you can use your dagger-like teeth to make an unarmed strike. You can use your Wisdom modifier, instead of Strength, for the attack and damage rolls with your bite. If you hit with it, you deal piercing damage equal to 1d12 + your Strength or Wisdom modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.\nBreath Weapon. You can use an action to exhale a plume of powerful energy from inside of you. Each creature in a 15-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. A creature takes 2d6 damage of your dragon’s damage type on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. Once you use this feature, it can’t be used again for 1 minute.\nYour breath weapon improves at certain levels. At 6th level, your breath weapon deals 3d6 damage and extends in a 20-foot cone. At 10th level, it deals 4d6 damage and extends in a 25-foot cone, and at 14th level it deals 5d6 damage and extends in a 30-foot cone.6th-level Circle of Dragons feature\nBy 6th level, your control over your dragon shape has improved, granting you the following benefits while in that form:\nYour AC is equal to 14 + your Dexterity modifier (maximum 2).\nYou gain a new way to attack:\nClaws. Your razor-sharp claws are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. You can use your Wisdom modifier, instead of Strength, for the attack and damage rolls with your claws. If you hit with them, you deal slashing damage equal to 2d6 + your Strength or Wisdom modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.\nWhen you take the Attack action on your turn, you can make one attack with your bite and one attack with your claws. Your attacks count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. You have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision from your race, its range increases by 30 feet.\n10th-level Circle of Dragons feature\nStarting at 10th level, you’re able to cast certain druid spells while in your dragon shape. To cast a spell while in this form, it must use a druid spell slot level of 3rd or lower, and it can’t require any material components. In addition, your scales continue to toughen and your wings have become strong enough to carry you. You gain the following benefits while in your dragon shape:\nYour AC is equal to 15 + your Dexterity modifier (maximum 2).\nYou have resistance to the damage type associated with your dragon shape.\nYou have a flying speed of 30 feet.\n14th-level Circle of Dragons feature\nAt 14th level, you can use your breath weapon even while you’re not in your dragon shape.Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest. In addition, you gain the following benefits while in your dragon shape:\nYour AC is equal to 16 + your Dexterity modifier (maximum 2).\nYour flying speed increases to 40 feet.\nWhen you take the Attack action on your turn, you can make three attacks: one with your bite, and two with your claws.\nFinally, when you take on your dragon shape, you can choose to become a Large dragon, instead of Medium. If you do, your bite has a reach of 10 feet, instead of 5.<br><a href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se?query=tag:RyokosGuideToTheYokaiRealms\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#RyokosGuideToTheYokaiRealms\">#RyokosGuideToTheYokaiRealms</a><br>\n<img alt=\"Druid - Circle of the Yokai.webp\" src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/classimages/druid-circle-of-the-yokai.webp\" target=\"_self\">\nDruids belonging to the Circle of the Yokai seek a connection to nature beyond the physical, aligning themselves with the mysterious yokai spirits that embody and inhabit the natural world. This connection allows such druids to assume yokai forms, becoming entities of nature while retaining their own mind and voice. Moreover, such druids can encourage roaming yokai spirits to settle in plants, flames, pebbles, and streams, turning these facets of nature into grasping weeds, furious wildfires, stalwart bastions of rock, or living wyrms of water.2nd-Level Circle of the Yokai Feature\nYou have formed a bond with the yokai, mysterious spirits that populate the land. Your connection to the Circle of the Yokai grants you access to some spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Circle of the Yokai Spells table. Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn’t appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.Circle of the Yokai Spells*See hapter 13 - Spells2nd-Level Circle of the Yokai Feature\nYour circle’s connection to the realms allows you to assume more powerful, yokai forms. In addition to mundane Beasts, you can use your Wild Shape to transform into any Beast, Celestial, Construct, Fey, Fiend, or Plant yokai with a CR up to the value in the Circle of the Yokai Wild Shapes table for your druid level.Circle of the Yokai Wild Shapes*Yokai found in Chapter 14 unless otherwise stated. **Found in Wrath of the Kaiju.In addition, while in any form using your Wild Shape, you retain more of your druidic power, granting the following benefits:\nYou can speak as normal.\nYou have advantage on Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration on a spell.\nYou can cast spells present in the Circle of the Yokai Spells table or in your Wild Shape form’s statistics without material or somatic components. You use your spell slots and druid spell save DC when casting these spells.\n6th-Level Circle of the Yokai Feature\nYour connection to the yokai allows you to channel their power when you draw upon your druidic spellcasting. Immediately after you cast a spell of 1st level or higher, you can use your Wild Shape feature as a reaction. Once you use this reaction, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.In addition, while you are concentrating on a spell and transformed by your Wild Shape, your weapon attacks count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.10th-Level Circle of the Yokai Feature\nYou have the power to call upon the Fey yokai that inhabit objects. You can cast the animate objects spell as an action without using a spell slot or material components. When you cast the spell in this way, the effect lasts for the next 10 minutes, after which time the magic ends and the target returns to normal. Once you do so, you must finish a long rest before you can cast it in this way again.14th-Level Circle of the Yokai Feature\nYour yokai forms overflow with magic, fortifying your connection to the spirit realm. If you drop to 0 hit points while transformed into a yokai with your Wild Shape, you can use your reaction to instantly use Wild Shape again (expending a use as normal), and any remaining damage carries over to your new form. Once you use this reaction, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.In addition, while transformed by your Wild Shape, if you use an action to cast a spell, you can use your bonus action on that turn to make one attack.<br><a href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se?query=tag:HelianasGuideToMonsterHunting\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#HelianasGuideToMonsterHunting\">#HelianasGuideToMonsterHunting</a><br>\n<img alt=\"Druid - Circle of the Hive.webp\" src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/classimages/druid-circle-of-the-hive.webp\" target=\"_self\">\nDruids of the Circle of the Hive share their body with a plethora of tiny arthropods—insects, arachnids, or even crustaceans. These symbiotes call such druids home, living within their skin, clothes, and hair. This habitation might manifest as a honeycomb-like hive, a silky subcutaneous trapdoor (below which lurks a spider), or butterfly chrysalids hanging from their hair. Druids of this circle relish creating a moving biosphere that sustains a variety of organisms, often seeking out new and exotic species as symbiotic lodgers. These creatures are a part of the druid, nourishing and protecting the druid as the druid nourishes and protects its tenants.2nd-level Circle of the Hive feature\nYour symbiotic link to arthropods and their versatility grants you access to certain spells. At 2nd level, you learn the swarm cantrip (see page 512).\nAt 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level, you gain access to the spells listed for that level in the Circle of the Hive Spells table. Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn’t appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.\nAll these spells use arthropods in their manifestation; for example, arcane eye or mislead could be a swarm of flies you conjure and imbue with different properties.2nd-level Circle of the Hive feature\nWhen you use your Wild Shape feature, you can turn into a swarm of creatures, adhering to the normal limitations on CR and speed.2nd-level Circle of the Hive feature\nThe symbiotes that inhabit your body flit in and around you, harmless until threatened. As a bonus action, you can release pheromones, stimulating hyper-aggression in your symbiotes for the next minute. The first time you are hit by a melee attack from a creature within 15 feet of you on its turn, the swarm retaliates, forcing the attacker to make a Constitution saving throw against your druid spell save DC. On a failure, the attacker takes 1d4 poison damage. The poison damage increases to 1d6 at 6th level, 1d8 at 10th level, and 1d10 at 14th level.\nAfter you activate this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.\nIn addition, you can communicate with arthropods using pheromones, conveying basic emotions and ideas.6th-level Circle of the Hive feature\nYour connection to the arthropods you host becomes deeper; they regard you as a worker bee would its queen, and they gladly sacrifice themselves to protect you. As a reaction when you take damage from a source you can see, you can command your insect symbiotes to swarm in front of you, deflecting some of the incoming energy. You gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your druid level, which take as much of the triggering damage as possible.\nYou lose any remaining temporary hit points at the end of the current turn. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum once), regaining all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.10th-level Circle of the Hive feature\nYou have attracted a species of flying arthropod that produces a mixture of sugar and adrenaline with amazing, stimulating properties. As a bonus action, you can send these creatures to invigorate a willing creature you can see within 30 feet of you.

Fighters are adept at many things and excel at what they set their mind to — all with the express purpose of being the last one standing. Will you rely on augmenting your martial prowess with magic, or focus on pure athleticism? Do you leap into the fray, axe at the ready, or hold back until only one option remains? Regardless of your chosen style of combat, fighters are always worthy allies on the battlefield.The Couatl Heralds were, or are, martial warriors whose intention was to neutralize threats without always resorting to deadly force. These combatants were a beloved symbol of peace in the once great city of Hearth, whose terrible destruction has been all but entirely lost to history. Perhaps you come from a long line of sequestered heralds who had escaped the city before its collapse, or maybe you found the age-old journals of one of the city’s training officers. Regardless of how you come across this knowledge, training, and virtue, a true Couatl Herald defends the lives of all: regardless of their transgressions.3rd-level Couatl Herald Feature\nWhen you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you understand that not every villain needs a bloody ending. You gain three motes of positive magic that can be used to fuel your interactions with other creatures. These motes are called mercy dice, which are d6s. You regain all of your expended mercy dice when you finish a short or long rest, and you regain 1 expended mercy die when you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points and choose to knock it out instead of killing it outright. Whenever you make a Wisdom (Insight) check or Charisma check, you can choose to roll one or more of these dice and add the number rolled to the ability check. You can wait until after you roll the d20 before deciding to use a mercy die, but must decide before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Alternatively, you can roll a mercy die as a bonus action to gain temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier + the number you rolled on the die.You keep a mercy die until it’s either used or you kill an unconscious creature you had already spared. When you reach 10th level in this class, your mercy dice turn into d8s, and at 15th level, they turn into d10s.\nIn addition, your carefully placed strikes allow you to knock a creature out with either melee or ranged attacks.3rd-level Couatl Herald Feature\nAt 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the Persuasion and Insight skills.7th-level Couatl Herald Feature\nStarting at 7th level, your weapon attacks count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. In addition, you can use an action to cast the calm emotions spell, without expending a spell slot. The saving throw DC for the spell equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier. Once you cast this spell, you can’t cast it again until you finish a short or long rest.10th-level Couatl Herald Feature\nBy 10th level, you gain an additional way to regain mercy dice. When you successfully persuade a creature to stand down or deescalate an otherwise violent situation, you regain 1 mercy die. If multiple creatures are persuaded in this way, you regain 1 mercy die for each affected creature.In addition, your mind is guarded against outside forces that would seek to sway your dedication. You can’t be charmed or frightened.15th-level Couatl Herald Feature\nStarting at 15th level, you can have up to five mercy dice at a time. You’ve also learned how to lead your allies using magical words of empowerment. As a bonus action, you can command a creature you can see within 30 feet of you, spending a mercy die. When you do, roll the die. If the creature can hear you, it gains temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier + the number you rolled on the mercy die and can immediately use its reaction to move up to half its speed and make one weapon attack.If a weapon attack made in this way reduces a creature to 0 hit points, that creature is magically knocked unconscious instead of killed outright by the attack.18th-level Couatl Herald Feature\nAt 18th level, your training has taught you to strike with the magic and force of a mighty couatl. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d10 force damage to the target. When you deal this force damage, you can choose to spend a mercy die to add an additional 1d10 force damage to the attack.In addition, if you choose to knock a creature out instead of killing it outright when you reduce it to 0 hit points, the target remains unconscious for 8 hours or until a creature friendly to you uses an action to shake it awake, even if the target regains hit points.<br><a href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se?query=tag:TheGriffonsSaddlebag_BookTwo\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#TheGriffonsSaddlebag_BookTwo\">#TheGriffonsSaddlebag_BookTwo</a><br>\n<img alt=\"Fighter - Steel Hawk.webp\" src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/classimages/fighter-steel-hawk.webp\" target=\"_self\">\nNot everyone who can tell you which end of a sword to hold is a fighter: that title is reserved for the trained guards, valiant knights, and masterful veterans of the world, and apart from their shared expertise with weapons, armor, and combat, few two fighters are exactly the same. Fighters are focused on the honing of their skill in combat, adapting to the settings around them and developing new solutions to the challenges they face. Some choose to focus on the mastery of one particular weapon or develop keen tactical skill, whereas others rely on clever magical forces to enhance their martial prowess. Beyond that, weapon and armor preferenceplay a significant part in determining a fighter’s role. When you are a fighter, you’re equipped to face the world’s dangers head-on.Powerful, nimble soldiers from the mountain city of Heavensteppe, Steel Hawks use explosive bursts of speed to launch themselves great distances in order to reach faraway threats. Despite their often heavy armor, those who follow this archetype leap and strike with the agility of seasoned assassins, becoming every inch the fearsome birds of prey their name would suggest.3rd-level Steel Hawk feature\nWhen you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn to magically launch yourself with a mighty leap. While standing on a solid surface, you can use a bonus action to leap horizontally, vertically, or a combination of both, up to a combined distance that totals no more than 15 feet. For example, you can choose to leap 10 feet horizontally and 5 feet vertically, potentially allowing you to avoid a dangerous trap or barricade blocking your path. When you reach 7th level in this class, the leap’s distance can total up to 30 feet instead.You can’t use this feature if your speed is 0, and if you leap completely horizontally, you still leap 1 foot off the ground. Leaping in this way doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks, and if you fall immediately after using this feature, you can subtract up to 30 feet from the fall when calculating falling damage. You can use this feature three times, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest. Beginning at 7th level, you can use this feature four times between rests, and beginning at 15th level, you can use it five times between rests.Leaping in this way can also strengthen your strikes by using the force of your momentum. If you make a melee weapon attack immediately after using Launch, you have advantage on the attack roll, and if the attack hits, the target takes an extra 1d8 damage of the weapon’s type. At 10th level, this extra damage becomes 1d10, and at 18th level, it becomes 1d12. The attack can be made immediately after you land at the end of the leap or during the leap’s movement.3rd-level Steel Hawk feature\nStarting at 3rd level, you are remarkably light on your feet and capable of counterbalancing even some of the most awkward of equipment. Lances have the versatile property for you while you’re not mounted, dealing 1d8 piercing damage on a hit when held with one hand and 1d12 piercing damage when wielded with two. When you use your Launch feature and immediately hit with a melee attack using a lance, it counts as if you’re wielding it with two hands.If you hit a creature within 5 feet of you using a lance, you can immediately move up to 5 feet away from it, without provoking an opportunity attack from the target.\nYou must be standing and have movement remaining in order to move in this way.3rd-level Steel Hawk feature\nAlso at 3rd level, you learn to identify common birds by their calls, and you have advantage on Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks when interacting with any beast that has an innate flying speed. In addition, you gain the ability to cast the animal messenger spell, but only as a ritual and only targeting a beast that has an innate flying speed.7th-level Steel Hawk feature\nStarting at 7th level, wearing armor doesn’t impose disadvantage on your Dexterity (Stealth) checks. In addition, whenever you make a Dexterity saving throw, you can use your Launch feature as a reaction. When you do so, you take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail. 10th-level Steel Hawk feature\nBeginning at 10th level, your attack made immediately after or during your Launch scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20. If you hit a flying creature with this attack, it must also make a Strength saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier). On a failed save, its speed is reduced to 0 feet until the start of its next turn.In addition, you gain proficiency in the Perception skill if you don’t already have it, and your proficiency bonus is doubled for any Wisdom (Perception) check you make that relies on sight.15th-level Steel Hawk feature\nStarting at 15th level, you have advantage on initiative rolls, and when you roll initiative and have no uses of Launch remaining, you regain one use.18th-level Steel Hawk feature\nStarting at 18th level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack immediately after or during your Launch, it must also succeed on a Strength saving throw (save DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or be knocked prone.In addition, you can push yourself beyond your normal limits when you use your Launch feature. When you do, your leap can total a maximum of 90 feet, instead of 30, and you don’t suffer any damage from falling until you land again. Once you use this feature, you shouldn’t do so again before you finish a short or long rest. Each time you do, you suffer one level of exhaustion. You can’t use this feature in this way if you’re suffering from two or more levels of exhaustion.<br><a href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se?query=tag:RyokosGuideToTheYokaiRealms\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#RyokosGuideToTheYokaiRealms\">#RyokosGuideToTheYokaiRealms</a><br>\n<img alt=\"Fighter - Skeletal Blade.webp\" src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/classimages/fighter-skeletal-blade.webp\" target=\"_self\">\nFolklore tells of a caste of downtrodden serfs, forbidden to carry weapons, gifted the power to wield their own skeletons as lethal instruments of battle by a sympathetic yokai. With carapaces of dense bone and vicious, osseous claws bursting from their flesh, the serfs overthrew their masters, winning freedom and a bloodsoaked notoriety. Today, practitioners of this devastating technique are known as Skeletal Blades. Often finding work as mercenaries, bodyguards, and spies, they charge into battle clad in an ever-adapting armour of gleaming skeletal white.3rd-Level Skeletal Blade Feature\nYou have the power to manipulate your skeleton, shifting your proportions, height, and appearance. As an action, you can alter your form, becoming up to 1 foot taller or shorter and changing your facial features by altering the shape of your skull.\nYou must remain in a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs, and you can’t change the colour of your eyes, hair, or skin. Otherwise, the extent of the transformation is up to you.\nTo discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check (DC equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus).\nThis transformation persists until you use your action to end it or until you begin a long rest. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of once), regaining all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.3rd-Level Skeletal Blade Feature\nWhile in your Skeletal Form, you sprout a vicious, jagged weapon through your flesh; this weapon is considered a simple melee weapon with the Finesse property that deals 1d8 slashing or piercing damage on a hit (you choose when you make the attack). It is magical for the sake of overcoming resistances and immunities. You can’t be disarmed of this weapon, which has the Skewer superior strike* option. You also gain one benefit of your choice from the list below:\nYour reach increases by 5 feet.\nYour walking speed increases by 10 feet.\nYou gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed.\nYou gain a +1 bonus to AC.\nYou gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier at the start of each of your turns (minimum of 1).\nAs a bonus action while in your Skeletal Form, you can change your skeleton again, exchanging your current benefit for a new one.\nThe damage of your bladed weapon increases when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d10 at 10th level and to 1d12 at 15th level.\n7th-Level Skeletal Blade Feature\nYou have learned to simultaneously maintain multiple boney extrusions. When you enter your Skeletal Form, you can choose one additional benefit, and you can choose one of the following weapon properties and superior strike* combinations for your extruded weapon: Impact &amp; Reeling Blow; Light &amp; Hamstring; or Heavy &amp; Shockwave.10th-Level Skeletal Blade Feature\nYour mastery of your skeleton allows you to focus it into more powerful forms. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with your skeletal blade. This bonus increases to +2 when you reach 18th level. Furthermore, when you enter your Skeletal Form, you can enhance yourself with one of the following additional benefits:\nYou sprout skeletal wings and gain the ability to magically fly. You gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed, and you can hover.\nYou gain resistance to cold, lightning, necrotic, and poison damage.\nWhen you hit with a melee attack, the attack deals an extra 1d8 necrotic damage.\nWhen a creature starts its turn grappled by you, it takes 2d12 piercing damage.\n15th-Level Skeletal Blade Feature\nYour skeleton is empowered with regenerative magic. If you are reduced to 0 hit points while in your Skeletal Form, your transformation ends, and you are reduced to 1 hit point instead.\nOnce you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.18th-Level Skeletal Blade Feature\nWhen you enter your Skeletal Form, you gain two additional benefits for the duration of your transformation, which can be chosen from either the Skeletal Form or Skeletal Knight features.*See Advanced Weapon Masteries, page 83<br><a href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se?query=tag:LArsenesLedger\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#LArsenesLedger\">#LArsenesLedger</a>\nThe taste of ale-soaked floorboards is a familiar flavour to Tavern Brawlers. Whether they’ve been thrown to the ground in a glorious takedown, blocked an improvised weapon with their teeth, or tackled a foe into a pile of flailing limbs, Tavern Brawlers cherish the memory of every scuffle that hasn’t been knocked out of their brains.Though most inns and pubs decry barroom brawls as unnecessarily damaging and expensive affairs, celebrated carpenter and philosopher Lottaw Ood proposed that without the constant kerfuffles, woodworkers and the entire lumber industry might collapse. In fact, more shrewd carpentry guilds have opened “Brawl-Inns”; taverns with dedicated brawling areas and a microtransaction economy that encourages fighters to purchase chairs with which to clout their fellow patrons.3rd-level Tavern Brawler featureYou’ve learned techniques that are fueled by special dice called Brawler dice, which are d4s. You have a number of these dice equal to twice your proficiency bonus. You regain all your expended Brawler dice when you finish a long rest.\nWhen you reach certain levels in this class, the size of your Brawler dice increases: at 5th level (d6), 11th level (d8), and 17th level (d10).Some of your techniques require your target to make a saving throw to resist the technique’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:\nTechnique save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifierThe techniques below use your Brawler dice. Creatures more than one size larger than you automatically succeed on any saving throws or contested checks against these techniques’ effects.Prerequisite: target grappled.\nWhen you make an unarmed strike with a free hand against a creature you are grappling, you can expend one Brawler die to force an additional contested grappling check instead of an attack roll. On a success, you deal the strike’s normal damage plus extra damage equal to one roll of your Brawler die, and the creature is restrained until the grapple ends or you use one of the hands you have grappling the target for something else.Prerequisite: target restrained.\nWhile you have a humanoid restrained (for example, by your Bind technique), you can use an action to expend one Brawler die and attempt to cut off the creature’s blood supply. The creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it takes bludgeoning damage equal to your Strength modifier plus two rolls of your Brawler die and immediately begins to be strangled until it is no longer restrained by you. On a success, it takes half as much damage and doesn’t begin to be strangled. A creature that is being strangled remains conscious for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum 1), and falls unconscious at the start of its next turn. A creature that is made unconscious in this manner regains consciousness if it takes any damage. If you continue to choke a creature beyond this point, it begins suffocating. If you release the creature, it remains unconscious for 1d20 + 10 minutes.Prerequisite: hit with improvised weapon melee weapon attack.\nWhen you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack using an improvised weapon, you can expend one Brawler die to deal extra bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage (GM’s decision) equal to one roll of your Brawler die. The object takes an equal amount of damage, possibly destroying it.Prerequisite: target grappled.\nWhen you make an unarmed strike against a creature you are grappling, you can expend one Brawler die to force an additional contested grappling check instead of an attack roll. On a success, you deal the strike’s normal damage plus extra damage equal to one roll of your Brawler die as you throw the target to the ground where it lands prone.3rd-level Tavern Brawler feature\nYour familiarity with patrons of bars and inns has left you adept at sensing their motives. You have advantage on Insight, Intimidation, and Persuasion checks against creatures that have been drinking.3rd-level Tavern Brawler feature\nYou’ve learned to use whatever weapons might be close at hand, often surprising foes with your ingenuity. You are proficient with improvised weapons and your unarmed strikes and improvised weapon attacks can deal damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier on a hit. This damage die increases when you reach 5th level (1d6), 11th level (1d8), and 17th level (1d10) in this class.You can pick up an object within your reach as part of the attack you make with that object. In addition, the first time you make an attack with an improvised weapon you picked up on that same turn, that attack scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.7th-level Tavern Brawler feature\nYou can attempt to grapple a creature as a bonus action on your turn, and you have advantage on attack rolls you make against creatures you are grappling. In addition, when you successfully apply the grappled condition to a creature, you can choose to painfully twist, dealing bludgeoning damage to the creature equal to a roll of your unarmed strike die plus your Strength modifier.10th-level Tavern Brawler feature\nYou can add double your proficiency bonus to contested Strength (Athletics) checks you make. When you make an ability check to grapple a creature or to escape a grapple, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.15th-level Tavern Brawler feature\nYears spent anticipating conflict in inns and taverns has given you a preternatural danger sense. You have advantage on initiative rolls, and you gain proficiency in the Insight skill. If you have this proficiency from another source, you can add twice your proficiency bonus to checks you make using that skill. As a bonus action on your turn, you can make a Wisdom (Insight) check against the passive Deception of a creature you can see. On a success, you learn the creature’s disposition towards you, such as whether it means you harm, views you as a friend, or wants something from you.18th-level Tavern Brawler feature\nWhen you roll initiative and have no Brawler dice remaining, you regain two Brawler dice. You learn new techniques that use your Brawler dice.Prerequisite: target restrained.\nWhen you have a creature restrained (for example, by your Bind technique) and take the Attack action, you can forgo two of your attacks to expend one Brawler die in a complex crushing manoeuvre. The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, it takes bludgeoning damage equal to your Strength modifier plus two rolls of your Brawler die and is stunned until the end of your next turn. On a success, it takes half as much damage and isn’t stunned.Prerequisite: target grappled.\nWhen you have a creature grappled and take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your attacks to expend one Brawler die and force the creature to make a Strength saving throw as you attempt to launch it. On a failure, you throw the creature horizontally away from you in a straight line up to 30 feet if it is a smaller size category than you, 20 feet if it is the same size as you, or 10 feet if it is one size category larger than you. The creature collides with the first solid object or creature in its path, causing both targets to take bludgeoning damage equal to one roll of your Brawler die plus your Strength modifier.When you move at least 10 feet directly towards a creature immediately before making an attack as part of the Attack action, you can forgo the attack to expend one Brawler die as you throw your entire body at your target. Make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target’s Dexterity (Acrobatics) or Strength (Athletics) check (its choice).

Whether channeled as a striking display of martial prowess or as a subtler manifestation of defense and speed, this power infuses all that a Monk does.Monks focus their internal power to create extraordinary, even supernatural, effects. They channel uncanny speed and strength into their attacks, with or without the use of weapons. In a Monk’s hands, even the most basic weapons can become sophisticated implements of combat mastery.Many Monks find that a structured life of ascetic withdrawal helps them cultivate the physical and mental focus they need to harness their power. Other Monks believe that immersing themselves in the vibrant confusion of life helps to fuel their determination and discipline.Monks generally view adventures as tests of their physical and mental development. They are driven by a desire to accomplish a greater mission than merely slaying monsters and plundering treasure; they strive to turn themselves into living weapons.Beginning at 1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier.At 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are shortswords and any simple melee weapons that don't have the two-handed or heavy property.You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you aren't wearing armor or wielding a shield: You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons. You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table. When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven't already taken a bonus action this turn. Certain monasteries use specialized forms of the monk weapons. For example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by a short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter blade (called a kama). Whatever name you use for a monk weapon, you can use the game statistics provided for the weapon on the <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/weapons\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/weapons\" target=\"_self\">Weapons</a> page.Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ki points. Your monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Ki Points column of the Monk table.You can spend these points to fuel various ki features. You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind. You learn more ki features as you gain levels in this class.When you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki points.Some of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:Ki save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier Flurry of Blows. Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action. Patient Defense. You can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn. Step of the Wind. You can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn. Starting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when you reach certain monk levels, as shown in the Monk table.At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move.Also at 2nd level, you train yourself to use a variety of weapons as monk weapons, not just simple melee weapons and shortswords. Whenever you finish a short or long rest, you can touch one weapon, focus your ki on it, and then count that weapon as a monk weapon until you use this feature again.The chosen weapon must meet these criteria: The weapon must be a simple or martial weapon. You must be proficient with it. It must lack the heavy and special properties. When you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a monastic tradition. Your tradition grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.Starting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level.If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free. If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a ranged attack with a range of 20/60 using the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught, as part of the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the missile counts as a monk weapon for the attack.Also at 3rd level, if you spend 1 ki point or more as part of your action on your turn, you can make one attack with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon as a bonus action before the end of the turn.When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.Beginning at 4th level, you can use your reaction when you fall to reduce any falling damage you take by an amount equal to five times your monk level.Also at 4th level, as an action, you can spend 2 ki points and roll a Martial Arts die. You regain a number of hit points equal to the number rolled plus your proficiency bonus.Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.<br>Optional 5th-Level Monk Feature - <a href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se?query=tag:RyokosGuideToTheYokaiRealms\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#RyokosGuideToTheYokaiRealms\">#RyokosGuideToTheYokaiRealms</a>\nThis feature replaces the Extra Attack feature and works with features that interact with Extra Attack. You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.When you reach 7th level in this class, you learn to capture your enemy’s ki as you strike, transferring its life force to revitalise your own. At the end of your turn, you gain temporary hit points equal to thrice the number of weapon attacks you made that hit a non-Construct creature that turn.Starting at 5th level, you can interfere with the flow of ki in an opponent's body. When you hit another creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 ki point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.Also at 5th level, when you miss with an attack roll, you can spend 1 to 3 ki points to increase your attack roll by 2 for each of these ki points you spend, potentially turning the miss into a hit.Starting at 6th level, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.At 7th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a blue dragon's lightning breath or a fireball spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.Starting at 7th level, you can use your action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened.At 10th level, your mastery of the ki flowing through you makes you immune to disease and poison.Starting at 13th level, you learn to touch the ki of other minds so that you understand all spoken languages. Moreover, any creature that can understand a language can understand what you say.Beginning at 14th level, your mastery of ki grants you proficiency in all saving throws.Additionally, whenever you make a saving throw and fail, you can spend 1 ki point to reroll it and take the second result.At 15th level, your ki sustains you so that you suffer none of the frailty of old age, and you can't be aged magically. You can still die of old age, however. In addition, you no longer need food or water.Beginning at 18th level, you can use your action to spend 4 ki points to become invisible for 1 minute. During that time, you also have resistance to all damage but force damage.<br>Additionally, you can spend 8 ki points to cast the <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:astral-projection\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:astral-projection\" target=\"_self\">astral projection</a> spell, without needing material components. When you do so, you can't take any other creatures with you.At 20th level, when you roll for initiative and have no ki points remaining, you regain 4 ki points.<br><a href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se?query=tag:TheGriffonsSaddlebag_BookOne\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#TheGriffonsSaddlebag_BookOne\">#TheGriffonsSaddlebag_BookOne</a><br>\n<img alt=\"00_attachments/ClassImages/Monk - Way of the Celestial.webp\" src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/classimages/monk-way-of-the-celestial.webp\" target=\"_self\">Traditions are closely kept secrets in many parts of the multiverse. No one monastery wants to be overrun by another that learns its weaknesses. These traditions are made known slowly, and carefully, as their monks seek new adventures with their newfound skills.Some traditions are as old as time immemorial, whereas others are new and unique. Monks’ focus on inner peace and harnessing the energy within makes for a bountiful range of combat and character options. How do you choose to train or advance your pursuit of personal perfection?Monks of the Way of the Celestial are peacekeepers and protectors of their chosen kin. These monks meditate to achieve a greater understanding of a divine being, granting them the ability to channel celestial energies into their own. These martial defenders are pensive, patient, and understanding, but offer little mercy when evil intentions are made clear.The Way of the Celestial originated from the lost city of Hearth as a tribute to the city’s guardian couatl protectors. While these teachings are far from common knowledge, there’s no telling what small, protected monasteries may still exist after the city’s untimely destruction. Regardless of how you come upon this tradition, the wisdom of the celestials guides its every principle.3rd-level Way of the Celestial Feature\nStarting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you can telepathically speak to any creature you can see within 30 feet of you. When you do, you don’t need to share a language with the creature for it to understand you, but the creature must be able to understand at least one language.3rd-level Way of the Celestial Feature\nAt 3rd level, you can spend 1 ki point when you touch a creature to peer into its soul. Until the start of your next turn, or for 1 minute if you are not in combat, you are aware of the creature’s emotional state and its most obvious desire. At the GM’s option, you may also discern its current number of hit points or one piece of the creature’s history. During this effect, you have advantage on any Wisdom (Insight) checks made to interact with that creature, and the next attack roll you make against that creature before the end of your turn has advantage.If you use this feature when you hit a creature with one of the attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows, you do not need to spend a ki point to use it.6th-level Way of the Celestial Feature\nAt 6th level, you can harness healing celestial energy and channel it using your ki. As an action, you can touch a willing creature with less than half its hit points left and spend 1 or more ki points. That creature regains 5 hit points for each point you spend, restoring it to no more than half its hit point maximum.In addition, you can spend 2 ki points as an action to cast enhance ability, lesser restoration, or protection from evil and good, requiring no material components.11th-level Way of the Celestial Feature\nBeginning at 11th level, your connection to celestials can be used to expand your mind’s reach. You can cast the dream or scrying spell, requiring no material components, using your ki save DC.\nWhen you cast dream using this feature, only you can act as the dream’s messenger. Once you cast a spell in this way, you can’t cast it again until you finish a long rest.In addition, you are immune to scrying and to any effect that would sense your emotions, read your thoughts, or detect your location.17th-level Way of the Celestial Feature\nAt 17th level, your energy is perfectly intertwined with both harmful and healing celestial magic. Your unarmed strikes deal an extra 1d4 radiant damage, and you can now use your Stabilizing Ki as a bonus action, instead of an action, to heal a creature up to 30 feet away from you.In addition, you gain a flying speed equal to your current walking speed. This benefit only works in short bursts; you fall if you end your turn in the air and nothing else is holding you aloft.<br><a href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se?query=tag:TheGriffonsSaddlebag_BookTwo\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#TheGriffonsSaddlebag_BookTwo\">#TheGriffonsSaddlebag_BookTwo</a><br>\n<img alt=\"Monk - Way of the Aether.webp\" src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/classimages/monk-way-of-the-aether.webp\" target=\"_self\">\nMonks harness the energy that flows through the bodies of living creatures, called ki, to accomplish breathtaking feats of strength and dexterity. Often using little more than their own fists, these pugilists are the height of physical prowess and natural potential. Depending on where they train, a monk will gain uncanny mastery over their ki and physical ability using ancient traditions and techniques that have been passed down from one generation to the next.Monks of the Way of the Aether tap into the energy of spirits and the Ethereal Plane. This energy is the fifth element, aether, which is contained by every living—and nonliving—soul. Sometimes called ghostfists, monks of this tradition explore the Material and Ethereal Planes on lifelong missions to give the souls of the dead a final resting place. By aligning the ki and aether within themselves, monks of this tradition treat their spirit as an extension of their physical bodies and move through the world unimpeded by material obstacles like a ghost.3rd-level Way of the Aether feature\nWhen you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you learn to send out blue flashes of spiritual energy to attack your foes. Whenever you make an unarmed strike, you can choose to make a melee spell attack with your spirit instead. You are proficient with this attack, which has a reach of 30 feet, and you add your Wisdom modifier to its attack and damage rolls. Its damage type is force, and its damage die is a d4. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table.When you reach 6th level in this class, you can use your Stunning Strike feature when you hit a creature with your Spirit Strike.3rd-level Way of the Aether feature\nAlso at 3rd level, you learn the mage hand cantrip, which you can cast and control as a bonus action. When you cast it, it doesn’t require verbal or somatic components. The hand from the spell appears as a blue, spiritual copy of your own.6th-level Way of the Aether feature\nStarting at 6th level, you can’t be possessed by ghosts or similar undead creatures, and you can use an action to spend 2 ki points to cast either the gentle repose or see invisibility spell, without providing material components. You also gain the spare the dying cantrip if you don’t already know it.Furthermore, you learn how to free certain souls from their undead vessels when you harness your ki. You gain the following ability:Dismiss Undead. When you hit an undead with one of the attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can force it to make a Wisdom saving throw against your ki save DC. On a failed save, its spirit leaves and is put to rest, causing the creature to either vanish or become an unmoving corpse once more. If the creature’s challenge rating is above the threshold shown in the following table, it automatically succeeds on the saving throw.If a creature has a bonus or penalty against any effect that turns undead, that bonus or penalty also applies to this effect.11th-level Way of the Aether feature\nBeginning at 11th level, you are familiar with how ghosts and creatures of the Border Ethereal meld into the Material Plane. You can choose to partially slip into the Ethereal Plane, granting you the following benefits:\nEtherstep. You can spend 1 ki point as a bonus action to turn invisible until the end of your next turn, or until you make an attack or cast a spell.<br>\nAlternatively, you can spend an extra ki point as part of your <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"#Ki\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/94_character_creation/classes-and-subclasses/monk.html#Ki_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Step of the Wind</a> to gain this benefit. When you do, you can also move through hostile creatures and solid objects no more than 4 inches thick for as long as you remain invisible.\nPhase. When you are hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the attack’s damage against you by an amount equal to your monk level as you partially slip into the Border Ethereal. You can use this ability a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.17th-level Way of the Aether feature\nAt 17th level, you gain truesight and telepathy out to 60 feet, as you are able to clearly see the world and connect to the souls within it using aether.In addition, you can use an action to cast the etherealness spell. When you do, the spell has a duration of 1 minute. Once you cast this spell, you can’t cast it again until you finish a long rest.<br><img alt=\"Monk - Way or the Eight Gates.webp\" src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/classimages/monk-way-or-the-eight-gates.webp\" target=\"_self\">\nMonks of this order strive for meaning and perfection through mastery of the Eight Gates, internal loci of spiralling energy through which ki is channelled. By way of personal contemplation and intense training, each gate can be opened in turn, and once brought into harmony, allow for a stronger channel of ki and the ability to push one’s body beyond mortal limitations. Those who follow the Way of the Eight Gates might be hermits, retreating from the chaos of the wider world and to a place of contemplative isolation.\nOthers may be wanderers, embracing and celebrating all experiences, believing this to be the path to internal harmony. In any case, monks who walk this path eschew organised\nreligious and spiritual practices, preferring to carve their own path of potential, freedom, and growth. Monks can have proficiency with the following new weapons: chakram, kusarigama, meteor hammer, nunchaku, rope dart, shuriken, and tessen.3rd-level Way of the Eight Gates feature<br>\nThe Gate of Earth reflects a being’s strong physical and spiritual foundation. Your ki grounds your centre, fortifying your body. When you use your <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"#Ki\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/94_character_creation/classes-and-subclasses/monk.html#Ki_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Patient Defense</a> or <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"#Ki\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/94_character_creation/classes-and-subclasses/monk.html#Ki_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Step of the Wind</a>, you regain hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1).3rd-level Way of the Eight Gates feature\nThe Gate of Water reflects a being’s natural ebb and flow of ki through the open gates. You have an additional number of ki points equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1).3rd-level Way of the Eight Gates feature\nThe Gate of Air expresses a being’s power of voice—the tool through which it communicates with the world. When you hit a creature with a melee attack, you can spend 1 ki point to issue a challenging roar. If the creature can hear you, it has disadvantage on attack rolls it makes against creatures other than you until the end of your next turn.6th-level Way of the Eight Gates feature\nThe Gate of Flame reflects a monk’s blistering power and speed, an internal pool of coiling, frenetic energy. When you use your Flurry of Blows, you can make one additional unarmed strike as a part of that same bonus action. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.6th-level Way of the Eight Gates feature\nThe Gate of Presence reflects a being’s voice, social wellness, and confidence. Whenever you make a Charisma check, you gain a bonus to the check equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of +1).11th-level Way of the Eight Gates feature\nThe Gate of Spirit represents a being’s ki flowing beyond their physical form; you have the power to share your ki with those around you. As a bonus action, you can touch one willing creature and expend 2 ki points. That creature gains temporary hit points equal to your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1), and it can immediately use its reaction to make a single weapon attack, take the Dodge action, or move up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.11th-level Way of the Eight Gates feature\nThe Gate of Mind represents a monk’s consciousness expanding beyond their physical form. You can cast the telepathic bond spell, requiring no components. Once you cast the spell with this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.17th-level Way of the Eight Gates feature\nYou have reached total harmony within yourself. Your gates align and converge with your ki, opening the final gate: the Gate of Infinity.As an action, you can spend 6 ki points to transcend to a state of apotheosis. You gain the following benefits for 1 minute:\nYour walking speed increases by 20 feet.\nYou have a +2 bonus to AC.\nWhen you take the Attack action, you can make one additional unarmed strike as a part of that action.\nYou can add your Wisdom modifier to your attack and damage rolls.\n<br><a href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se?query=tag:LArsenesLedger\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#LArsenesLedger\">#LArsenesLedger</a>\nTo a monk who follows the Way of the Artisan, taking raw materials and giving them shape and purpose is considered the noblest of pursuits. The act of creation is the purest form of meditation, an exercise in creativity and discipline that hones both mind and spirit, leading the craftsman on a never-ending journey of self-discovery.\nAn adherent of this philosophy seeks true perfection in their craft while accepting that this is a fundamentally unachievable goal. What matters is that they grow and improve themselves along the way, creating art and tools that better the world in the process. In this manner, artisan monks are much like the objects they craft, for they too start off full of raw potential that is ultimately given shape and purpose.3rd-Level Way of the Artisan Feature\nA worker is only as good as their tools, and yours are an extension of your own body, such is the graceful ease with which you manipulate them. You gain proficiency with two types of artisan’s tools of your choice. In addition, you can use sets of artisan’s tools you’re proficient with as weapons, using everyday objects in unconventional ways to catch your foes off guard. They count as monk weapons for you, but their damage die is one size larger than your Martial Arts die. (For example, if your Martial Arts die is a d6, the damage die of your artisan’s tools is a d8.) They deal bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage (your choice each time you hit with them), and when you gain the Ki-Empowered Strikes feature at 6th level, it also applies to attacks made with your artisan’s tools.3rd-Level Way of the Artisan Feature\nWhen you say that you put a small piece of your soul into each of your creations, you mean that very literally. When you finish a long rest, you can use your artisan’s tools to craft a number of Tiny objects up to your Wisdom modifier (minimum one). These objects take the shape of things you would be able to create with your tools—for example, you can use a set of woodcarver’s tools to create a wooden figurine, or a set of cobbler’s tools to create a shoe—and each one gains 1 ki point, which is stored within it. When you spend a ki point as part of your Deflect Missiles, Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, or Step of the Wind features, you can choose to expend that ki from one of your objects, as long as you have that object on your person. An object with no ki points in it is destroyed. You can have a maximum number of objects created in this way equal to your Wisdom modifier. If creating a new object would put you over this limit, you must choose another object to be destroyed. When you reach 11th level in this class, each object you create using this feature starts with 2 ki points instead of 1.6th-Level Way of the Artisan Feature\nYou draw both power and inspiration from the pieces you create, allowing you to make your martial arts more intricate and formidable. When you spend a ki point from one of your Soulful Craft objects, you gain additional benefits depending on what you use it for:\nDeflect Missiles: You have advantage on the attack roll, and it deals an extra 1d10 damage.\nFlurry of Blows: You can replace one or both of the unarmed strikes with attacks made with your artisan’s tools.\nPatient Defense: While you have the benefit of the Dodge action, if a creature misses you with an attack roll, you can use your reaction to make an attack against it using your artisan’s tools.\nStep of the Wind: You take both the Dash and Disengage actions.\n11th-Level Way of the Artisan Feature\nEvery scratch and bump in a work of art tells a story, and you have become an expert at deciphering and interpreting these untold tales. You can spend 10 minutes touching a Medium or smaller creature-made object and meditating to try and discern its history. At the end of that time, make a DC 15 Wisdom check. You have advantage on the check if you are proficient with a set of artisan’s tools that could be used to craft that object. If the object was created with your Soulful Craft feature, you automatically succeed on the check, but the object is destroyed in the process. If you succeed, you gain the following benefits:\nYou learn the name, creature type, and appearance of each creature that touched the object within the last 24 hours.\nYou learn every location the object has been in for the last 24 hours, and its trajectory, if it was moved.\nYou can choose a point in time within the last 24 hours, and receive a vision of events unfolding within 30 feet of the object during that time, as if you were standing in the object’s space. This vision includes sight, sound, and smell, and lasts for 10 minutes or until you decide to end it.\nOnce you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest, and you can’t use it on the same object again.\n17th-Level Way of the Artisan Feature\nNothing lasts forever. A true artist must learn to detach themselves from what they have created and look ahead to what they have yet to bring to life. When you are reduced to 0 hit points as a result of taking damage, you can choose to draw vigor from one of your creations to fight on. If you have one of your Soulful Craft objects on your person, you can destroy it, preventing yourself from falling unconscious and regaining 2d8 hit points for each ki point in the object. You can then immediately move up to half your speed without triggering opportunity attacks. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.Whenever you start crafting a magic item using the rules in Heliana’s Guide to Monster Hunting or in Chapter 3 of this book, you can expend 1 or more ki points, devoting some of your spiritual energy to the item’s creation. If you do, you gain a bonus to the enchanting or forging check you make at the end of the process to create the item equal to the number of ki points invested; your maximum number of ki points is reduced by the same amount until you make that check. The maximum number of ki points you can invest at once is based on your monk level, as detailed in the table

src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/classimages/paladin-oath-of-the-hearth.webp\" target=\"_self\">There are always opposing forces to fight. When a new villain emerges in the world, there are those that fight for their beliefs to fend it off. Paladins are the first and most outspoken line of defense against these forces, and swear an oath to uphold their deepest core beliefs in doing so. The oaths they swear vary in scope and severity, but all paladins believe that their path is the one true answer.Some oaths focus on peace, whereas others believe in outright combat superiority. There will always be new causes and methods to uphold justice, and with them will be the virtuous paladins who bravely follow them.The Oath of the Hearth originates from the city of the same name, whose tragic downfall has been all but lost to history over centuries. These paladins swore an oath to protect this tropical, sunlit city in the name of their celestial guardians. Until the end, they fulfilled their oaths. You may swear this oath because you have an age-old connection to the city through your bloodline, or may have established a connection to the city’s principles through stories or interaction with a related celestial being. Regardless of your reasons for taking it, those that swear this oath adorn their armor with symbols of community, fire, and the sun to reflect their commitment to the city and the lives that were led there.The tenets of the Oath of the Hearth are linked directly to the once-flourishing city of the oath’s origin. The culture was vibrant and open, and thrived under the tropical sun in the Elsath Jungle. They were supportive of children’s imagination and new ideas, and as a community would rush to foster good creativity. With new ideas came progress and prosperity, and with each new generation, the future always looked brighter. The core principles of this oath are devoted to supporting the weak, developing community, and destroying the evils that would seek to harm them.\nShield the Embers. Protect those that can’t defend themselves. Every ember is a fount of possibility and strength.\nFeed the Fire. Keep the fires of passion burning. New ideas light the way to progress and salvation.\nShare the Warmth. Offer guidance and kindness to those that need it. Respite and rest are always free to give.\nBurn Away Evil. Turn those that would harm the innocent or douse the peoples’ flames to ash.\nYou gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.3rd-level Oath of the Hearth Feature\nWhen you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.Burning Weapon. As a bonus action, you can ignite one weapon that you’re holding with fiery energy using your Channel Divinity. For 1 minute, you deal extra fire damage with that weapon equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). The weapon also emits bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. If the weapon is not already magical, it becomes magical for the duration.You can end this effect on your turn (no action required). If you are no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends.Warming Respite. Your Channel Divinity can enhance the healing powers of a good rest. When you or any friendly creatures who can see you finish a short rest, you can use your Channel Divinity to grant each of those creatures a number of temporary hit points equal to your paladin level.7th-level Oath of the Hearth Feature\nStarting at 7th level, you and friendly creatures within 10&nbsp; feet of you have resistance to cold and fire damage while&nbsp; you are conscious.At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.15th-level Oath of the Hearth Feature\nBeginning at 15th level, whenever you expend a spell slot, you and friendly creatures within your Aura of Warmth gain a number of temporary hit points equal to the spell slot’s level + your Charisma modifier.20th-level Oath of the Hearth Feature\nAt 20th level, as an action, you can magically ignite yourself to embody your fiery soul for 1 minute. These flames are harmless to you and cast bright light in a 40-foot radius and dim light for an additional 40 feet. The flames invigorate you, giving you 10 temporary hit points at the start of each of your turns. While in this form, you become more lithe and fluid in your movements, increasing your speed by 10 feet and allowing you to move through and enter a hostile creature’s space and stop there. Hostile creatures are hurt by these flames as punishment for their transgressions. A hostile creature takes fire damage equal to twice your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) whenever it touches you, hits you with a melee attack, or whenever you enter its space for the first time on your turn. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.<br><a href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se?query=tag:HelianasGuideToMonsterHunting\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#HelianasGuideToMonsterHunting\">#HelianasGuideToMonsterHunting</a><br>\n<img alt=\"Paladin - Oath of the Harvest.webp\" src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/classimages/paladin-oath-of-the-harvest.webp\" target=\"_self\">The Oath of the Harvest attracts paladins who wish to nourish and heal the world. Often found on aid missions to war-torn lands, such paladins resort to harm only as a means of preventing further suffering. Paladins who swear this oath are more likely than not to heal, feed, and nurture a wounded foe, provided the defeated creature gives its word of honour that it will cease its nefarious activities. They are no fools, however. Typically versed in religion and medicine, these paladins are unlikely to believe the word of creatures inherently inclined to lie, or those that have previously broken their word.The tenets of the Oath of the Harvest inspire their followers to seek out potential harm and quell it before it blossoms.\nShare Your Meal. Your powers are a gift to be shared; if someone is in need, you must use your power to meet those needs. To eat your fill while another goes hungry is selfish.\nNurture Over Cure. Act in the greatest interest of the many. Find ways to prevent harm before it must be healed.\nPermit Prosperity. Whether in matters of love, politics, or war, always give your antagonist the opportunity to change and redeem themselves before casting a fatal judgment. A good meal can serve as the backdrop to such events.\n3rd-level Oath of the Harvest feature\nAlways keen to fortify others with flavourful food, you’ve spent hours slicing, dicing, and cooking. You gain proficiency with cook’s utensils.3rd-level Oath of the Harvest feature\nYou gain the oath spells at the paladin levels listed in the Oath of the Harvest Spells table.

See the Sacred Oath class feature for how Channel Divinity works.\nVow of Sustenance. As a bonus action, you can place a ward around one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. When you use this bonus action, and at the start of each of its turns for the next minute, the creature gains temporary hit points equal to twice your Charisma modifier (minimum 2).Share Vitality. As a bonus action, you can take any amount of necrotic damage up to your current number of hit points, which can’t be reduced in any way. Up to four creatures you can see within 30 feet of you regain hit points equal to half the necrotic damage taken.7th-level Oath of the Harvest feature\nYou emanate an aura that increases the potency of magical healing and hearty meals. Whenever a creature of your choice within 10 feet of you regains hit points from a spell, potion, magical effect, or food, it regains an additional 1d6 hit points. When a creature rolls one or more Hit Dice to regain hit points during a short rest, it regains 1 additional hit point for each Hit Dice expended in this way, so long as it spends the majority of the short rest within 10 feet of you.When you reach 18th level in this class, the range of the aura increases to 30 feet.15th-level Oath of the Harvest feature\nOver the course of an hour (which can be done during a short rest), you can magically augment a meal (mundane or magical) for you and up to nine other creatures, using 25 gp of rare spices and 25 gp of diamond dust. Once consumed, a creature that partakes of the feast gains the following benefits for the next 8 hours:\nThe creature has advantage on Constitution saving throws.\nThe creature has resistance to poison damage.\nThe creature is immune to the frightened condition.\nThe creature gains 2d10 temporary hit points.\nAfter you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.20th-level Oath of the Harvest feature\nAs a bonus action, you become a wellspring of lifeforce, gaining the following benefits for the next minute:\nAt the start of each of your turns, each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you (including you) regains hit points equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1) and gains temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1).\nAs bonus action, you can cast the revivify spell without having it prepared and without expending a spell slot (material components are still required).\nWhenever a creature within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to grant the creature resistance to that damage.\nAfter you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a 5th-level spell slot to use it again.<br><a href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se?query=tag:TheGriffonsSaddlebag_BookTwo\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#TheGriffonsSaddlebag_BookTwo\">#TheGriffonsSaddlebag_BookTwo</a><br>\n<img alt=\"Paladin - Oath of the Spelldrinker.webp\" src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/classimages/paladin-oath-of-the-spelldrinker.webp\" target=\"_self\">\nPaladins are zealous warriors given might by their cause. Some swear oaths to rid the world of certain creatures or to be a champion of peace, whereas others exist simply to restore a sense of balance in the world as they see fit. Most paladins are good, although some of the strongest and most feared have turned to work in support of evil instead. Regardless of their virtues, it is this unwavering conviction among paladins that serves as the source of their strength: a commitment to righteousness, or at least their version of it, that fuels their every decision.There are countless paladins across the multiverse, many of whose views are at odds with the next one’s. What creature or cause has wronged you, or is so important to you that it drives you headlong into the forces that oppose you? These beliefs will impact the oaths and paths you take to in order to uphold them.The Oath of the Spelldrinker is devoted to ridding the world of renegade mages, such as liches or the occult, in order to protect the helpless from the forces of evil magic. The paladins who swear this oath believe in maintaining the balance of power between the ordinary and the extraordinary, including themselves. These paladins are resourceful and quick to remember their own mortality and privilege, often choosing to pursue mundane solutions before magical ones. Despite their caution, these wardens of balance are exemplary arcanists who can feel the weave of magic in the world as keenly as some of the finest sorcerers.The tenets of the Oath of the Spelldrinker were written and passed down by cautious guardians set to rid the world of evil mages. They emphasize balance within oneself through the following tenets:\nBe the Sword. Be a stalwart champion of fairness and equality among all. The sword doesn’t cheat fate: it dances with it.\nBe the Shield. Defend the innocent against the forces of rampant magic. The shield is patient and unwavering in the face of the unknown.\nBe the Spell. Use your power to provide balance and guidance. The spell can lead to prosperity as easily as it can to ruin: you must always choose the righteous path.You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.3rd-level Spelldrinker feature\nWhen you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the follow ing two Channel Divinity options.\nAbsorb Magic. You can refute certain spells and use them to nourish yourself. Using your Channel Divinity, you can interrupt a creature you can see within 30 feet of you casting a spell. You can use a reaction when you see a creature within range casting a spell to present your holy symbol and interrupt it. The spell fails and has no effect if it is of a level no higher than 1 + your paladin level divided by 3 (rounded up), to a maximum of 6th-level spells. When it does, you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier, plus 5 times the spell’s level.\nExpeditious Command. You can use your Channel Divinity to issue a word of power and release a wave of invigorating energy from your holy symbol. As a bonus action, choose a number of creatures within 30 feet of you up to your Charisma modifier (minimum one creature). Until the start of your next turn, the chosen creatures can use a bonus action to take either Dash or Disengage action. As part of using your Channel Divinity in this way, you can also take either the Dash or Disengage action.3rd-level Spelldrinker feature\nStarting at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the Arcana skill.7th-level Spelldrinker feature\nBeginning at 7th level, the arcane energy that hangs around you is volatile to enemy spellcasters. Whenever a hostile creature ends its turn within 10 feet of you while concentrating on a spell, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your paladin spell save DC or lose concentration on the spell. In addition, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can’t be perceived through magical scrying sensors.\nAt 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.15th-level Spelldrinker feature\nStarting at 15th level, while you are concentrating on a paladin spell, your concentration can’t be broken as a result of taking damage.20th-level Spelldrinker feature\nAt 20th level, as an action, you can emanate a field of crackling magic in a 30-foot radius. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits: You have resistance to damage from spells and have advantage on saving throws against spells.\nWhenever a creature hits you with a melee attack, that creature takes force damage equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) as magical energy lashes out at them.\nWhen you expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher, friendly creatures in the field regain a number of hit points equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1), while hostile ones take force damage equal to the same amount instead.\nOnce you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.\n<br><a href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se?query=tag:RyokosGuideToTheYokaiRealms\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#RyokosGuideToTheYokaiRealms\">#RyokosGuideToTheYokaiRealms</a><br>\n<img alt=\"Paladin - Oath of the Yojimbo.webp\" src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/classimages/paladin-oath-of-the-yojimbo.webp\" target=\"_self\">\nYojimbo are sworn to protect those to whom they dedicate their service, be it an individual, a group, or an entire nation. Though Yojimbo typically pledge their allegiance to a charge and accompany them until death, a defenceless soul might find the raking claws of a dodomeki halted inches from their face by the serendipitous intervention of a wandering Yojimbo paladin. These roaming saviours traverse the realms on an unrelenting quest to shield those who can’t protect themselves. Despite being in high demand—unshakeable loyalty is a coveted virtue—Yojimbo rarely pledge themselves to the wealthy or powerful. It’s said that a true Yojimbo has the value of ten sellswords in battle, and ten thousand sellswords in spirit.Tenets of the Yojimbo\nThe tenets of the Oath of the Yojimbo are unflinchingly resolute. They do not change or vary, no matter whom a paladin pledges to protect.Protection\nBe a shield to those who lack a shield of their own. Be the weapon that meets the blade of those who would slaughter the weaponless.Strength\nGrow strong, for the sake of those who cannot. To shelter the vulnerable, one must have the power to hold back the storm.Inspiration\nNurture the weak. Do not merely preserve the vulnerable; raise them up to be strong, so they might, in turn, protect others.Self-Sacrifice\nWager everything for the safety of those who cannot fight. Nothing less is acceptable in the defence against tyranny.Oath Spells\n3rd-Level Oath of the Yojimbo Feature\nYou gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed in the Oath of the Yojimbo Spells table. See the Sacred Oath class feature for how oath spells work.Oath of the Yojimbo Spells\n| Paladin Level | Spells |\n|:--------------|:-------|\n| 3rd | heroism, sanctuary |\n| 5th | earthskin, warding bond |\n| 9th | spirit guardians, switcheroo |\n| 13th | death ward, steelskin |\n| 17th | Bakuryō’s blessèd blizzard, wall of force |\n*See Chapter 13 - SpellsChannel Divinity\n3rd-Level Oath of the Yojimbo Feature\nYou gain the following Channel Divinity options. See the Sacred Oath class feature for how Channel Divinity works.Holy Ward\nYou can use your Channel Divinity to perform a 1-minute divine ritual of protection, dedicating yourself to the service of a willing creature that stays within 30 feet of you during the entire ritual. The target becomes your ward for the next 24 hours, until you use this feature again, or until it dies. For the duration, your ward is immune to the frightened condition while you are conscious and within 60 feet of it. In addition, when your ward hits an enemy you can see with a weapon attack while within 60 feet of you, you can use a reaction and expend one spell slot to cause the attack to deal extra radiant damage to the target. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8.Guardian’s Intervention\nAs a reaction, you can use your Channel Divinity to reduce the damage dealt by an attack to a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. When you do so, the damage the creature takes is reduced by a number of d10s equal to half your paladin level. If this feature reduces that damage to 0, the creature you protected can immediately use its reaction to make one weapon attack against the creature that attacked it.Daring Protector\n7th-Level Oath of the Yojimbo Feature\nYour divine power flows out from you. When an ally within 10 feet of you becomes the target of a melee attack, you can use your reaction to move up to your speed towards the attacker. If you end your movement within 5 feet of the attacker, you force it to target you with the attack instead. At 18th level, the range of this feature increases from 10 feet to 30 feet.True Guardian\n15th-Level Oath of the Yojimbo Feature\nYou are a master at providing aid in battle. You can take the Help action or use your Lay on Hands feature as a bonus action.

The spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn’t count against the number of ranger spells you know.3rd-level Winter Trapper Feature\nAt 3rd level, you learn how to keep your prey exactly where you want them. Once on each of your turns when you make a weapon attack, you can attempt to pin down that target. You make this choice before rolling the attack. If it hits, the target takes an extra 1d8 damage of the weapon’s type and its speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.When you reach 11th level in this class, the extra damage increases to 2d8, and if the attack hits, the target also can’t take reactions until the start of your next turn.7th-level Winter Trapper Feature\nBy 7th level, you know how best to keep your footing. While you’re not incapacitated, you can’t be knocked prone.In addition, your archetype’s wintry history grants you additional benefits. You ignore difficult terrain created by ice or snow, and you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks while in icy or snowy terrain.7th-level Winter Trapper Feature\nAlso at 7th level, attacking a prone creature doesn’t impose disadvantage on your ranged attack rolls.11th-level Winter Trapper Feature\nAt 11th level, you’ve learned how to quickly set undetectable magical traps. You can imperceptibly create one of these magical snares in the ground at your feet as a bonus action on your turn. The first Large or smaller creature other than you that steps in that space within 1 minute must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 piercing damage and has its speed reduced to 0 until the end of its current turn, as the ground opens up and clamps down on it. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much piercing damage, and its speed is unaffected.When you create a snare, you can designate any creatures you choose, and the trap ignores them. A creature that can see invisible creatures and objects (such as one benefiting from see invisibility or truesight) can see these traps. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.15th-level Winter Trapper Feature\nAt 15th level, you have learned to use a creature’s mistakes against them. When a Large or smaller creature within 5 feet of you that you can see misses you with an attack, you can use your reaction to knock that creature prone. When you do, you can make either one weapon attack against that creature or move up to half your speed immediately after its attack.<br><a href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se?query=tag:TheGriffonsSaddlebag_BookTwo\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#TheGriffonsSaddlebag_BookTwo\">#TheGriffonsSaddlebag_BookTwo</a><br>\n<img alt=\"Ranger - Rocborne.webp\" src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/classimages/ranger-rocborne.webp\" target=\"_self\">\nRangers guard the realms against all manner of evil, both natural and unnatural. These intrepid hunters are as capable of felling great beasts as they are hiding in plain sight. Masters of tracking and survival skills, rangers are often the first to discover and warn others of impending danger, calling upon natural magics to aid them in their attempts to rid the world of corruption. Depending on their origin and focus, a ranger is just as likely to be seen traversing cursed swamps as they are to be leaping from rooftops in new and mysterious planes of existence. The Rocborne are nomads of the sky who travel the world on the backs of ancestral rocs. These travelers understand that the air and wind aren’t just one force but the collective effort of untold numbers of spirits that are carried along by it. By listening to the wind the same way a medium beckons to the dead, a Rocborne can learn more about the weather, their path forward, and even themselves. Many Rocborne grow up and live in this culture for their entire lives, but some have been known to begin their own journeys. Alternatively, your path may have been crossed by a powerful windborne spirit later on in life, allowing you to suddenly feel and heed the guiding wind inside you. By calling on the spirits of the wind to aid them, rang- ers of this archetype can exert a degree of control over both wind and weather. These skills were passed down from the rocs to the first Rocborne and continue to live on through the dedicated instruction of Rocborne elders, both living and dead. You may be taught these skills or have them passed on to you through the guidance of Rocborne spirits in whispers, dreams, or in moments of deep meditation.3rd-level Rocborne feature\nStarting at 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Rocborne Spells table. The spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn’t count against the number of ranger spells you know.3rd-level Rocborne feature\nStarting at 3rd level, when you make an attack, you can whisper to the wind to have it aid your strikes. Once on each of your turns, you can choose to gain one of the following benefits:\nWhen you hit with a weapon attack, the target takes an extra 1d4 damage of the weapon’s type. When you reach 11th level in this class, the extra damage increases to 1d8.\nWhen you miss with a weapon attack, you can change its trajectory to attack a different target up to 5 feet away from the original one and within range of your weapon. When you do, your attack roll against the new target is equal to the original attack roll plus your Wisdom modifier (minimum of +0). When you reach 11th level in this class, the new target can be up to 15 feet away as long as it’s still within range of your weapon.\n3rd-level Rocborne feature\nAlso at 3rd level, you can seek knowledge through med- itation by calling upon the spirits carried on the wind. You can spend 10 minutes communing with these spirits to gain proficiency in one skill or tool of your choice that you don’t already have proficiency in, as a traveling spirit shares its knowledge with you. You lose this proficiency the next time you use this feature or finish a short or long rest. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. 7th-level Rocborne feature\nBy 7th level, the wind clears a path for you and ushers you forward. Your walking speed increases by 5 feet, you ignore any movement penalty caused by strong wind, and you can’t be pushed because of strong wind against your will.In addition, you have resistance to cold damage, and you’re acclimated to high altitudes, including elevations above 20,000 feet. 11th-level Rocborne feature\nAt 11th level, you can use a bonus action immediately af- ter you make a running jump to grow a pair of spectral, roc-like wings that last until the end of your next turn or until you touch the ground again. While the wings are present, you have a flying speed equal to your walking speed. 15th-level Rocborne feature\nAt 15th level, your connection to the wind is so strong that its spirits can come to your defense as a magical, buffeting tempest. When you take damage, you can use your reaction to give yourself resistance to that dam- age, or take no damage instead if it was falling damage. When you do, each creature of your choice within 15 feet of you must make a Strength saving throw against your ranger spell save DC. On a failed save, a creature takes bludgeoning damage equal to your ranger level and is knocked prone. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t knocked prone. When you use this feature, you can choose to allow the wind spirits to immediately fly you to an unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet of you, without provoking opportunity attacks. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest<br><a href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se?query=tag:RyokosGuideToTheYokaiRealms\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#RyokosGuideToTheYokaiRealms\">#RyokosGuideToTheYokaiRealms</a><br>\n<img alt=\"Ranger - Rōnin 1.webp\" src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/classimages/ranger-rōnin-1.webp\" target=\"_self\"><br>\n<img alt=\"Ranger - Rōnin 2.webp\" src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/classimages/ranger-rōnin-2.webp\" target=\"_self\">\nThe Rōnin are masterless, wandering warriors, beholden to no code but their own. No two are the same, each with their own tale that led them down the warrior’s path. They are masters of many weapons, striking with blade and arrow in a spectacle of blinding speed and accuracy. Some Rōnin use their power to protect the vulnerable—vigilantes doing what they see as right, no matter the cost. Others pursue their own ends, unfettered by the consequences of their actions. Rōnin are dangerous combatants, hardened survivors, and above all things, free.3rd-Level Rōnin Feature\nYou have mastered the art of striking with sudden, explosive power at any moment. The first time each turn that you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack using a weapon you drew that turn, the attack deals an extra 1d6 damage of that weapon’s type. This extra damage increases to 1d10 when you reach 11th level in this class.\nOnce per turn, when you make an opportunity attack, you can draw a weapon as part of that attack.\nIn addition, you can perform two additional object interactions each turn, but you can only use these additional object interactions to draw or stow weapons.Creatures can draw or stow one weapon as part of an object interaction on their turn, but drawing a second weapon requires an action. Rōnin rangers’ Slash Draw feature allows them to draw or stow a weapon thrice on their turn, without requiring an action to do so.3rd-Level Rōnin Feature\nYou learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Wandering Magic Spells table. Each spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn’t count against the number of ranger spells you know.3rd-Level Rōnin Feature\nYou are a solitary warrior, shackled by no code or authority beyond your own. Whenever you make a saving throw to avoid or end the charmed condition on yourself, roll a d6 and add the number rolled to the saving throw.7th-Level Rōnin Feature\nWhen a creature makes a weapon attack against you while you have a stowed melee weapon and a free hand, you can use your reaction to attempt to parry that blow, drawing your stowed weapon as you do so. Your AC increases by an amount equal to your Dexterity or Strength modifier (your choice) against that attack, and you gain temporary hit points equal to your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1). After the attack hits or misses, you can then stow that weapon as a part of this reaction.11th-Level Rōnin Feature\nYou have advantage on the first melee weapon attack you make each turn, as well as advantage on the first ranged weapon attack you make each turn.\nIn addition, being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesn’t impose disadvantage on your ranged attack rolls.15th-Level Rōnin Feature\nThe speed and ferocity of your onslaught is legendary. When you take the Attack action, each time you score a critical hit or reduce a creature to 0 hit points as part of that action, you can make one additional weapon attack. You can make up to three additional attacks with this feature per turn.<br><a href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se?query=tag:HelianasGuideToMonsterHunting\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#HelianasGuideToMonsterHunting\">#HelianasGuideToMonsterHunting</a><br>\n<img alt=\"Ranger - Trapper.webp\" src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/classimages/ranger-trapper.webp\" target=\"_self\">\nThrough careful preparation, trappers can create both physical and magical traps to ensnare, explode, or enrapture those unlucky enough to find themselves in their vicinity. Trappers are found in all terrains where there are creatures to be hunted. With tact and guile as their companions, a trapper can lay low even the mightiest of prized beasts.3rd-level Trapper feature\nHaving learnt how to create traps, you’ve gained an understanding of how to thwart the traps of others. You gain proficiency with thieves’ tools and you add double your proficiency bonus to any ability check you make using those tools to disarm or manipulate a trap.3rd-level Trapper feature\nWhen you finish a short or long rest, you can augment one weapon or up to twenty pieces of ammunition that you are holding with a concealed, magical augmentation. You decide whether the augmentation deals acid, cold, fire, or lightning damage. The augmentation lasts until you finish a short or long rest.Once per turn, when you hit a target with a weapon attack using the augmented weapon or ammunition, you can activate the concealed augment (no action required). The target of your attack takes 1d8 extra damage of the associated type. At 11th level, you can augment one additional item or up to 20 additional pieces of ammunition when you finish a short or long rest, and the damage increases to 2d8.3rd-level Trapper feature\nAt 3rd level, and later at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level, you learn how to make new traps, as detailed on the Trapper Traps table, below. Details of these traps can be found on pages 188 - 190.Creating a physical trap takes 1 hour (which can be done during a short or long rest) and uses trap-making materials (valued in gp) specified in the trap’s description. After a physical trap activates, its materials are consumed and the trap can’t be used again. However, over the course of 10 minutes, you can salvage half the trap-making materials used in the physical trap’s construction if it hasn’t activated yet.Immediately after you finish a long rest, you can create magical traps—up to a number equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1)—choosing from the options in the Ranger Traps section on page 188. Some of these traps require you to expend spell slots in their creation. When you finish a long rest, all undeployed magical traps lose their effects.While a physical trap’s description specifies how it is activated, you have flexibility in activating your magical traps. When you deploy a magical trap, you can choose a size of creature and a distance of up to 30 feet. When a creature of that size or larger comes within the specified distance of an armed trap, the trap activates. As another option, you can intentionally activate an armed magical trap within 150 feet of you using a bonus action or a reaction (with no specific trigger).p indicates physical; m indicates magical.As an action, you can throw a trap you have created to an unoccupied space you can see on the ground within 30 feet of you, where it arms itself at the start of your next turn. A trap deployed in this way is plainly visible to all creatures.\nOver the course of 1 minute, you can conceal a trap. A concealed trap can be noticed by a creature that uses its action to make a Wisdom (Perception) check against your ranger save DC and succeeds.Attempting to move an armed trap causes it to activate, unleashing its effects. A creature within reach of a trap can use its action to make a Dexterity (thieves’ tools) check (for physical traps) or a spellcasting ability (Arcana) check (for magical traps) against your ranger save DC. On a success, the trap is disarmed. On a failure, the trap activates and the creature has disadvantage on any saving throw it makes to resist the trap’s effects.\nAs an action, you can remotely disarm one of your traps that is within 150 feet of you.Spell effects created by a trap don’t require concentration. When a trap calls for a saving throw, the DC equals your ranger spell save DC. You can have multiple traps deployed, but any attempt to deploy a magical trap whose centre is within 40 feet of the centre of another magical trap fails. Creatures with truesight or that are under the influence of the detect magic spell can notice a magical trap’s presence, even if it has been concealed.1 gp worth of trap-making materials weighs 1 lb.7th-level Trapper feature\nYou are an expert at detecting and obscuring tracks. When you make an ability check to find or follow tracks, you can add your proficiency bonus to the result of the check, even if you aren’t proficient in the relevant skill. If you are already proficient in the relevant skill, your proficiency bonus is doubled for that check.7th-level Trapper feature\nThe merest hiss of escaping air, depression of a tile, or scent of ozone is all the warning you need to avoid traps’ effects. When you are subjected to a trap’s activation effect that allows you to make a saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail. In addition, if a trap makes an attack roll against you, that attack roll has disadvantage.\nThis feature doesn’t function against a trap’s ongoing effects. For example, you can mitigate the effect of a poisonous cloud as it is being released by holding your breath or covering your skin, but on subsequent rounds, the cloud’s saving throw would affect you as normal on a success or failure.11th-level Trapper feature\nYou’ve learnt to use magic to hide traps, allowing them to be concealed in the heat of battle. When you deploy a trap, you can expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher to disguise the trap with illusion magic, causing it to become invisible the moment it leaves your hands. Creatures don’t see where the trap lands and, if it’s a physical trap, have disadvantage on saving throws made to avoid the trap’s effects.\nIn addition, you learn the invisibility spell, which counts as a ranger spell for you, but doesn’t count against the number of ranger spells you know. You can cast it once without using a spell slot, and you regain the ability to cast it in this way when you finish a short or long rest.15th-level Trapper feature\nYou trap your own body against unexpected demise. When you finish a long rest, you can choose one of the following magical effects with which to augment your body until you finish a long rest. After triggering an effect that activates when you are reduced to 0 hit points, that effect can’t trigger again until you finish a long rest.Once per turn, when a creature hits you with a melee attack, you can trigger an electrical discharge (no action required). The creature is unable to take reactions until the start of its next turn unless it is immune to lightning damage, and you can immediately move up to 10 feet without provoking opportunity attacks. After you move using this feature, you can’t do so again until the start of your next turn.\nWhen you are reduced to 0 hit points and not killed outright, you can instead drop to 1 hit point and immediately take an extra turn, interrupting the current turn. If you don’t regain any hit points before the end of your next turn, you drop to 0 hit points, fall unconscious, and begin making death saving throws as normal.Once per turn, when a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, you can trigger a spurt of acid to coat its weapon or limb (no action required). If the melee attack was a spell attack or made with a natural weapon, the creature takes 1d6 acid damage. If the result of the attack roll meets your AC and is made with a ferrous, non-magical, non-natural weapon, the acid causes the metal to weaken and the weapon is destroyed.\nWhen you are reduced to 0 hit points, all your concealed acid charges gush outward. Each creature within 10 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw against your ranger spell save DC. On a failed save, a creature takes 10d4 acid damage and an additional 5d4 acid damage at the start of each of its turns for the next minute until it uses an action to wipe itself clean. In addition, on a failure, if the creature rolled a 1 on the d20 for its saving throw and is wearing nonmagical, ferrous armour, the armour seizes. While wearing the armour, the creature’s speed is halved, its AC is reduced by 2, and it has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.Once per turn, when a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, you can trigger a burst of cold that ripples along the attacker’s limb (no action required). The creature takes 1d4 cold damage and its speed is reduced by 15 feet until the end of its next turn unless it is immune to cold damage.\nWhen you are reduced to 0 hit points, you become entombed in a block of clear ice that has AC 15, 100 hit points, immunity to cold damage, and vulnerability to fire damage. This icy block lasts for 1 minute or until it is destroyed. While the ice persists, you have total cover against all effects and you don’t make death saving throws. If you regain 1 or more hit points, the icy block melts at the start of your next turn.Once per turn, when a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, you can cause a small, shaped charge to detonate (no action required). You take 1 fire damage and the creature takes 1d8 fire damage.\nWhen you are reduced to 0 hit points, you erupt in an immense ball of fire and immediately fail one death saving throw. Each creature within 20 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw against your ranger spell save DC. A creature takes 14d6 fire damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one.The Set Trap feature lets you use a variety of physical and magical traps. Each trap requires you to be a certain ranger level before you can create it. The traps are presented here by level.\nPhysical traps require trap-making materials (which can be purchased from most general goods stores), while magical traps require the expenditure of spell slots. When a trap calls for a saving throw, the DC equals your ranger spell save DC.<br>\nThere is a table of all traps here: <a data-href=\"#Ranger Traps Table\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/94_character_creation/classes-and-subclasses/ranger.html#Ranger_Traps_Table_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ranger Traps Table</a>, if that's your vibe.3rd-level ranger; physical; 4 gp of trap-making materials.\nYou trap a 5-foot square with a mechanical, toothy-jawed trap. When a Large or smaller creature enters the trapped area, the trap activates and the creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 2d8 piercing damage, and its speed becomes 0 feet unless it’s immune to being grappled. A creature can use its action to make a Strength (Athletics) check against your ranger save DC, freeing the trapped creature on a success.3rd-level ranger; magical; 1st-level spell slot.\nWhen activated, twisted, knotting roots burst through the ground, creating an effect identical to the entangle spell within a 20-foot-radius circle centred on the trap for the next minute.3rd-level ranger; physical; 2 gp of trap-making materials.\nThe bear trap’s non-lethal cousin, the snare trap, tangles a creature’s feet, causing it to fall. You trap a 5-foot square with ropes and vines. When a Large or smaller creature moves into the trapped area, the trap activates and the creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone, and its speed becomes 0 feet unless it’s immune to being grappled. A creature can use its action to make a Strength (Athletics) check against your ranger save DC, freeing the trapped creature on a success.3rd-level ranger; magical; 1st-level spell slot.\nWhen activated, hard spikes and thorns sprout in a 20-foot-radius circle centred on the trap, creating an effect identical to the spike growth spell for the next minute.5th-level ranger; magical; 2nd-level spell slot.\nWhen activated, a 20-foot-radius sphere of flame erupts, centred on the trap. Each creature in the area when the trap detonates must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d6 fire damage on a failure, or half as much damage on a success.5th-level ranger; magical; 2nd-level spell slot.\nWhen activated, a 20-foot-radius sphere centred on the trap fills with gas for the next minute or until strong wind disperses it. The gas spreads around corners, lightly obscures the area, and penetrates through creatures’ skin, affecting them even if they hold their breath or don’t need to breathe. When a creature enters the area for the first time on its turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 3d6 poison damage and becomes poisoned until the start of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t poisoned. While poisoned in this way, a creature has disadvantage on saving throws it makes to maintain its concentration.5th-level ranger; magical; 2nd-level spell slot.\nWhen activated, there is a flare of brilliant octarine light, and each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centred on the trap must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or become soulbound, as per the preserve spell (see page 509). In addition, while a creature is soulbound in this way, it can’t benefit from being invisible. Creatures possessing robust or more powerful essence within their bodies (typically, those of CR 7 or higher) automatically succeed on this saving throw.\nYou can expend a spell slot of 4th level or higher when you create this trap instead of a 2nd-level slot. When you do so, creatures with robust or less powerful essence (typically CR 11 or lower) must make the saving throw, while creatures with potent or more powerful essence automatically succeed.5th-level ranger; physical; 2 gp of trap-making materials.\nBecause of their nature, pit traps are deployed in the space in which they are created as soon as their construction is finished, and can’t be moved. After the trap activates, you can spend 1 minute recovering it, allowing it to be used again.\nYou dig a 7-foot-deep hole in dirt, or another diggable surface, in a 5-foot square. You can choose to fill the pit with sharpened stakes, spikes, or any other sharp materials.\nWhen a Medium or smaller creature moves into the trapped area, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, it falls into the pit, where it lands prone, taking 4d8 piercing damage if the trap is filled with spikes. On a success, it avoids the trap, falling prone in the nearest unoccupied space to the trap. A creature that succeeds on the save by 5 or more doesn’t fall prone.9th-level ranger; magical; 3rd-level spell slot.\nWhen activated, horrifying illusions abound and psychic energy twists the minds of creatures. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centred on the trap must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 3d10 psychic damage and becomes affected as per the confusion spell for the next minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.9th-level ranger; physical; 10 gp of trap-making materials.\nWith a large, concealed net of rope or vines, and an apparatus hidden in branches or a cave’s ceiling, you create a 20-foot square trapped area. Choose a 5-foot square within the trapped area to act as the trigger. When a Small or larger creature enters this square, the trap activates and each creature in the area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be restrained and hoisted 20 feet up into the air (or as high as the canopy/ceiling allows).\nA creature can use its action to make a Strength check against your ranger save DC, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) ends the effect and destroys the net.\nIf there is a Huge or larger creature in the trapped area when it triggers, the trap breaks and has no effect.9th-level ranger; magical; 3rd-level spell slot.\nWhen activated, a 30-foot-radius sphere centred on the trap erupts with deafening thunder. Each creature in the area must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 8d6 thunder damage and be deafened for the next minute. The noise can be heard 2,000 feet away, or even further in echoey locations or underwater.13th-level ranger; physical; 15 gp of trap-making materials.\nBecause of their nature, catapult traps are deployed in the space in which they are created as soon as their construction is finished, and can’t be moved.\nWith bent trees, springs, or elastic rope, you create a 20-foot square of tension. Choose a 5-foot square within the trapped area to act as the trigger. When a Small or larger creature enters this square, the trap activates and each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, a creature can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is no longer in the area. If it’s still in the area, it is affected as if it failed its save. A creature that fails the saving throw is flung 60 feet in a direction you decide when you deploy the trap, landing prone and taking 6d10 bludgeoning damage.\nIf there is a Gargantuan creature in the trapped area when it triggers, the trap breaks and has no effect.13th-level ranger; magical; 4th-level spell slot.\nWhen you create this trap, choose one of the diseases from the contagion spell. When activated, pustulant boils grow and erupt on surfaces in a 20-foot-radius sphere centred on the trap. Each creature in the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature is affected as if hit by the attack in the contagion spell (using the disease you chose).13th-level ranger; magical; 4th-level spell slot.\nWhen activated, the area within a 20-foot-radius sphere centred on the trap suddenly drops to a debilitatingly low temperature for the next minute. When a creature enters the area for the first time on its turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 6d6 cold damage and, until the start of its next turn, its speed is halved and it can’t take reactions. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t otherwise affected.17th-level ranger; magical; 5th-level spell slot.\nWhen activated, a 10-foot-radius sphere centred on the trap flares into life, attempting to suck all creatures in it into a harmless demiplane. Each creature in the area when the trap activates must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be transported to the demiplane for the next minute. At the end of this minute, the creature reappears in the space it left, or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.17th-level ranger; magical; 5th-level spell slot.\nWhen activated, gravity begins accumulating in a 30-foot-radius circle centred on the trap. The trapped area becomes difficult terrain until the end of the ranger’s next turn. Each creature in the area when the trap activates must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone. Furthermore, each creature in the area that is concentrating must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature’s concentration is broken.\nA creature that starts its turn in the area must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take 2d8 force damage and be pulled 15 feet towards the trap’s centre.\nAt the end of the ranger’s next turn, the gravity reaches a critical mass and each creature in the area must make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, a creature is knocked prone, pulled to the trap’s centre, and takes 6d8 force damage. On a success, a creature isn’t knocked prone or moved, and takes half as much force damage.Certainly!

src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/classimages/rogue-runetagger.webp\" target=\"_self\">Dexterous fighters and brigands are full of surprises. Trained assassins, spies, and cutpurses are classic rogues, but where there are new dangers and rewards to be gained, so too are the kinds of people seeking to subvert and claim them. Whether they slink through shadows to avoid detection or walk harmlessly through danger, every rogue has trained to develop their own methods of handling life’s threats.You concentrate your efforts on perfecting your art, developing special marks to claim and cripple your targets. Rebel leaders, artists, spies, and other members of the political underworld might belong to this archetype. Originally a tactic for subterfuge and assassination for denizens of the Festerwood, those who employ these powerful works of art are famously difficult to pin down. The magical marks left behind become a calling card for any runetagger, and as their strength and notoriety grow from the deeds that they commit (both good and evil), so too does the renown for their art.3rd-level Runetagger Feature\nStarting at 3rd level, you’re never without your brushes. You gain proficiency in calligrapher’s supplies and painter’s supplies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled whenever you make an ability check that uses either of these tools.In addition, whenever you finish making a mark or rune with ink or paint, you can imbue it with the effects of the message spell. When you do, the mark is visibly magical and casts dim light in a 5-foot radius. A creature that touches&nbsp; the glowing mark telepathically hears the message you&nbsp; imbued in it. Once a message is heard, the magic fades&nbsp; from the mark.You always have at least one paint or calligraphy brush on your person and can either create or purchase inks and pigments as part of your downtime activities. You can improvise these tools over the course of 10 minutes, assembling them from objects in your environment.3rd-level Runetagger Feature\nWhen you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain four rune points to fuel various magical effects. When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 rune point to mark that target with a magical rune in a flourish of paint and weaponry. These runes remain on a marked target for 1 minute, even if its magic has faded, or until a creature uses its action to wipe it off. You regain all spent rune points when you finish a short or long rest.When you mark a creature with a rune, you can choose to leave one of the following runes:Cryos. The creature can’t take reactions until the start of your next turn. The rune’s magic fades at the start of your next turn.Hexxus. The creature is cursed with an enervating rune. While a creature is marked with this rune, you can use your reaction to activate it when the marked creature makes an attack roll or ability check, reducing the total of the attack roll or ability check by 1d6. You must be within 60 feet and be able to see the creature in order to activate the rune. You can choose to activate the rune after the creature makes its roll, but before the GM determines whether the attack roll or ability check succeeds or fails. Once the rune has been activated, its magic fades.Locus. The next attack against the marked creature is made with advantage, and if that attack hits, it deals an extra 1d6 acid damage. Hit or miss, the rune’s magic fades after the next attack is made against the marked creature.9th-level Runetagger Feature\nAt 9th level you become slippery and evasive, capable of worming out of even the tightest holds. You have advantage on ability checks and saving throws made to escape from and resist being grappled or restrained, and when you are grappled or restrained, you can attempt to escape as a bonus action. In addition, you gain a new way to use your rune points. When you’re next to a wall or similar surface, you can use a bonus action to spend 1 rune point to place a rune on it using ink or paint. When you do, you become invisible until you move or take an action or a reaction. 13th-level Runetagger Feature\nWhen you reach 13th level, your mastery over the arts is lauded by friends and feared by foes. When you have no rune points remaining, you gain 1 rune point when you score a critical hit against a creature and when you roll initiative.17th-level Runetagger Feature\nBy 17th level, you’re able to apply more ink or paint whenever you leave a rune and use it to expose weak points in a target’s defense and guide your strikes. You can use your Sneak Attack against any creature that has a rune on it. When you do, that creature takes an extra 2d6 damage from the attack.<br><a href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se?query=tag:TheGriffonsSaddlebag_BookTwo\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#TheGriffonsSaddlebag_BookTwo\">#TheGriffonsSaddlebag_BookTwo</a><br>\n<img alt=\"Rogue - Grim Surgeon.webp\" src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/classimages/rogue-grim-surgeon.webp\" target=\"_self\">\nDexterous fighters and brigands are full of surprises. Trained assassins, spies, and cutpurses are classic rogues, but where there are new dangers and rewards to be gained, so too are the kinds of people seeking to subvert and claim them. Whether they slink through shadows to avoid detection or walk harmlessly through danger, every rogue has trained to develop their own methods of handling life’s threats. You’ve developed a unique familiarity with knives, bodies, and blood in your line of work. Like a tinkerer’s knowledge of clockwork and gears, you’ve come to an understanding of how bodies are put together instead. Medical experts in rough or war-torn cities and villages may follow this archetype, but so do rogues who take a particular interest in either clerical or necromantic magic. A grim surgeon uses medical knowledge and strange blood magic to dismantle foes, restore allies, and control bodies like puppets3rd-level Grim Surgeon feature\nWhen you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the Medicine skill if you don’t already have it. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses this skill. In addition, your familiarity with blood has become magical, giving you some degree of control over it. As a result, you can use a bonus action to magically stabilize an unconscious creature within 5 feet of you.You can use this same magic when you apply traditional healing techniques. You can use a bonus action to expend one use of a healer’s kit on a creature. When you do, that creature regains hit points equal 1d4 + your proficiency bonus. The creature can’t regain hit points from this feature again until it finishes a short or long rest.3rd-level Grim Surgeon feature\nStarting at 3rd level, once on each of your turns when you deal Sneak Attack damage to a creature that isn’t a construct or an undead, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1).\nWhen you reach 13th level, you gain temporary hit points equal to twice your Wisdom modifier instead. These temporary hit points last until the start of your next turn.9th-level Grim Surgeon feature\nBy 9th level, your medical expertise and blood magic allow you to painlessly mend an ally’s wounds using surgical techniques. You decide to use this feature at the start of a short rest, choosing a willing creature within your reach when you do. Roll your Sneak Attack dice and record the result. At the end of the short rest, that creature regains a number of hit points equal to the total of your Sneak Attack dice roll.\nOnce a creature regains hit points from this feature, it can't do so again until it finishes a long rest.13th-level Grim Surgeon feature\nAt 13th level, when you gain temporary hit points from your Transfusion feature, the target of the attack is overcome by a wave of sickness. Until the end of its next turn, the target’s speed is reduced by 10 feet, and it has disadvantage on the next attack roll or ability check that it makes before the end of its next turn.17th-level Grim Surgeon feature\nBy 17th level, you can command the blood inside certain creatures. Immediately after you deal Sneak Attack damage to a beast or humanoid, you can force that creature to make a Constitution saving throw. The DC is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier. On a failed save, that creature is under the effect of the dominate beast or dominate person spell, respectively, for 1 minute or until you choose to end the effect (no action required).\nOnce you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.<br><a href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se?query=tag:RyokosGuideToTheYokaiRealms\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#RyokosGuideToTheYokaiRealms\">#RyokosGuideToTheYokaiRealms</a><br>\n<img alt=\"Rogue - Tamaya.webp\" src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/classimages/rogue-tamaya.webp\" target=\"_self\">\nOptional Proficiencies.\nRogues can have proficiency with the following new weapons: chakram, sai, shuriken, tessen, and tonfa.The secrets of hanabi, alchemical fabrications that explode in dazzling arrays of light and sound, are some of the most well-guarded of any of the artificing guilds. However, no ship is entirely without leaks, and well-kept secrets fetch a high price. Whether from a jaded pyrotechnician, stolen formulae, or enough coin in the right hands, some enterprising individuals learn these clandestine secrets. Known as Tamaya, such rogues use the pseudo-magic of fireworks as weapons to supplement their gunpowder-fuelled toolbox, sending enemies spiraling into disarray and chaos. Using artifice and ingenuity, these masters of thunder, fire, and smoke prove true the old adage: sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.Pyrotechnician\n3rd-Level Tamaya Feature\nYou are adept at crafting explosives and pyrotechnics from simple ingredients. You gain proficiency with magitech firearms*, as well as with two artisan’s tools of your choice.\n*See Heliana’s Guide or L’Arsene’s LedgerSpellbombs\n3rd-Level Tamaya Feature\nYou have mastered the skill of crafting tiny orbs that, using natural chemicals and sophisticated mechanisms, can replicate magical effects: spellbombs. You have a unique resource you use to craft these bombs: hanabi points. You have a number of hanabi points equal to your rogue level, and you regain all expended points when you finish a long rest.\nOver the course of 10 minutes, you can choose one spell from the Tamaya Spellbombs table and store its effects within an armed, nonmagical spellbomb. Constructing a spellbomb also expends hanabi points, as shown in the Tamaya Spellbombs table. Spellbombs weigh half a pound, and disintegrate harmlessly when their creator finishes a long rest.\nA creature can use its bonus action to throw a spellbomb up to 60 feet. They are harmless unless detonated. You can use a reaction at any time to detonate a spellbomb that you created whenever it is within 60 feet of you. When a spellbomb detonates, the spell contained within comes into effect, centred on the point at which the spellbomb detonated. If that spell requires concentration, it lasts for the full duration or until it is dispelled.Spellbomb Ability.\nIntelligence is your ability for your spellbombs. You use your Intelligence whenever a spellbomb’s effect refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a spellbomb you detonate.\nSpellbomb save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifierTamaya Spellbombs*See Chapter 13 - Spells **Ringed wall onlyGritty Realism &amp; Gold\nOptional Rule.\nIf you are playing in a campaign with more realism, consider including a gold cost for the creation of spellbombs. In a campaign with average gold rewards, you can require a cost in gold pieces equal to three times the number of hanabi points required for the spellbomb. Spellbombs with no hanabi point requirement cost 1 sp.Initiative Shift\n9th-Level Tamaya Feature\nYou are adept at using sound, light, and smoke to get the drop on your enemies. When you roll initiative, you can use your reaction to throw out a disorienting barrage of flashbangs and smoke at a point within 60 feet of you. Each creature of your choice within a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spellbomb save DC. On a failed save, a creature takes a -10 penalty to its initiative roll.Spellbomb Adept\n13th-Level Tamaya Feature\nThrough extensive exposure to the raw, volatile components of spellbombs, you are inured to their worst effects. You are immune to damage from your own spellbombs and automatically succeed on saving throws to resist their effects.\nIn addition, you can use an action to detonate a spellbomb that you created that is within 1,000 feet of you.Hanabi Primer\n17th-Level Tamaya Feature\nAs an action, you can expend 3 hanabi points to set and conceal a special explosive spellbomb either upon a surface (such as a table, a section of floor, or a wall) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book or a chest).\nThe spellbomb is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check (DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier) to be found. You decide what triggers the bomb to detonate when you create it. Typical triggers include touching or standing on the bomb, removing an object covering it, approaching within a certain distance of the bomb, or manipulating the object that holds the bomb.\nYou can further refine the trigger so the bomb detonates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature type or kind (for example, the bomb could be set to detonate in the presence of Aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can designate a number of creatures equal to your proficiency bonus to not trigger the bomb under these circumstances when you set it.\nWhen triggered, the spellbomb detonates with deafening force in a 20-foot-radius sphere. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the sphere must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spellbomb save DC. A creature takes 6d6 thunder damage and 6d6 acid, fire, lightning, or poison damage (your choice when you set the spellbomb) on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nWhen you create a hanabi primer, any previous primers you have created using this feature disintegrate harmlessly. Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.<br><a href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se?query=tag:LArsenesLedger\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#LArsenesLedger\">#LArsenesLedger</a>\nFraudster, cheat, scammer, shyster… to be a confidence trickster is to alienate yourself from society one gullible mark at a time. However, as the saying goes, “you can’t cheat an honest man”, so they probably deserved it, right? Plus, pulling off a perfectly planned scam can be so fun. Charlatans are masters of planned deceit and misdirection. A Charlatan might prepare several disguises and waltz into a jewelry store, wait for a perfectly timed explosion to distract the proprietor, then replace a priceless tiara with a poorly-forged replica. Hot-footing it out the door, the Charlatan might switch outfits quicker than the proprietor can say “Oh my word, where’s that priceless tiara I tricked a down-on-her luck noble into selling for a pittance?”. The Charlatan might then direct the pursuing, nonplussed guards into a side alley, before fencing the heirloom and heading to a bar to celebrate a job well done. In combat, Charlatans appear as harmless bystanders before using concealed weapons to surprise foes, striking with devastating consequences.Premeditation\n3rd-Level Charlatan Feature\nConning is like cooking, and a trickster’s tools are the ingredients with which they cook up a plot, creating delectable morsels that the gullible are all too keen to consume. You gain proficiency with the disguise kit and your choice of the forgery kit or any artisan’s tools. When you reach 9th, 13th, and 17th level in this class, choose another tool from this list with which to gain proficiency. In addition, you have advantage on any ability checks made to find a willing buyer for your purloined or otherwise misappropriated goods.Hidden Weapons\n3rd-Level Charlatan Feature\nLong sleeves and concealed pockets turn a Charlatan into a walking inventory of hidden paraphernalia. When you have a free hand and take the Attack action, you can turn one attack against a creature into a special hidden weapon attack using a weapon concealed upon your person. To do so, the weapon must have the Thrown and Finesse properties. When you do so, make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check against your target’s passive Perception score. On a success, you make the attack roll with advantage.Teamwork Makes the Scheme Work.\nA Charlatan can achieve much more as part of a team. Starting at 9th level, if you succeed on this Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check by 10 or more, the target becomes confused and the next attack roll against it by a creature other than you before the start of your next turn has advantage. At 17th level, any number of attacks you make can be turned into a hidden weapon attack, instead of only one when you take the Attack action, provided the weapon has the Thrown and Finesse properties.Costume Change\n9th-Level Charlatan Feature\nThe ability to play multiple roles, and switch between them on the fly, expands the repertoire of scams a Charlatan can undertake. When you finish a long rest and you have a disguise kit, you can prepare a number of personas equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). These personas are replete with mannerisms, accents, quick-change costumes, and even different smells. They can have different clothing and other belongings, they can seem 1 foot shorter or taller than you, and they can appear thin, fat, or in between.Quick Change.\nAs an action, you can change into one of your personas. So long as a creature can’t see you when you take this action (for example, if you are hidden or behind opaque total cover), the creature doesn’t recognise you as the same person when it sees you in your new persona. If a hostile creature can’t fathom how you might have escaped, it is likely to be suspicious of you, even in your new persona. A creature can use its action to inspect your appearance, discerning your disguise if it succeeds on an Intelligence (Investigation) check (DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier). A very suspicious creature may detain you anyway (GM’s discretion), and a creature inclined to violence (such as a hunting owlbear) will likely continue to attack despite any apparent difference in appearance.Surprise!\n13th-Level Charlatan Feature\nYou can give yourself a bonus to your initiative rolls equal to your Charisma modifier. In addition, when you succeed on your Hidden Weapons ability check, you score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.Harmless\n17th-Level Charlatan Feature\nYou are a master of appearing harmless. When you roll initiative, until an enemy observes you making an attack, dealing damage to another creature, or casting a spell that affects a creature other than you, it considers you harmless. While it views you this way and it can see at least one other creature that it is hostile towards, it must first succeed on a Wisdom saving throw before it can target you with an attack or other effect (DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier).","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#class"],"headers":[{"heading":"Rogue Features","level":1,"id":"Rogue_Features_0"},{"heading":"Subclasses","level":1,"id":"Subclasses_0"},{"heading":"Runetagger","level":2,"id":"Runetagger_0"},{"heading":"Impressionist","level":3,"id":"Impressionist_0"},{"heading":"Runes","level":3,"id":"Runes_0"},{"heading":"Escape Artist","level":3,"id":"Escape_Artist_0"},{"heading":"Resourceful","level":3,"id":"Resourceful_0"},{"heading":"Lead Paint","level":3,"id":"Lead_Paint_0"},{"heading":"Grim Surgeon","level":2,"id":"Grim_Surgeon_0"},{"heading":"MEDIC","level":3,"id":"MEDIC_0"},{"heading":"TRANSFUSION","level":3,"id":"TRANSFUSION_0"},{"heading":"FIELD SURGEON","level":3,"id":"FIELD_SURGEON_0"},{"heading":"TOXIC SHOCK","level":3,"id":"TOXIC_SHOCK_0"},{"heading":"BLOODBOUND","level":3,"id":"BLOODBOUND_0"},{"heading":"Tamaya","level":2,"id":"Tamaya_0"},{"heading":"Charlatan","level":2,"id":"Charlatan_0"},{"heading":"Rogue Archetype","level":2,"id":"Rogue_Archetype_0"},{"heading":"Rogue Archetype","level":2,"id":"Rogue_Archetype_1"},{"heading":"Rogue Archetype","level":2,"id":"Rogue_Archetype_2"},{"heading":"Rogue Archetype","level":2,"id":"Rogue_Archetype_3"},{"heading":"Rogue Archetype","level":2,"id":"Rogue_Archetype_4"},{"heading":"Rogue Archetype","level":2,"id":"Rogue_Archetype_5"},{"heading":"Rogue Archetype","level":2,"id":"Rogue_Archetype_6"}],"links":["?query=tag:TheGriffonsSaddlebag_BookOne","?query=tag:TheGriffonsSaddlebag_BookTwo","?query=tag:RyokosGuideToTheYokaiRealms","?query=tag:LArsenesLedger"],"author":"Rasmus","coverImageURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se","fullURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/94_character_creation/classes-and-subclasses/rogue.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":["00_attachments/classimages/rogue-runetagger.webp","00_attachments/classimages/rogue-grim-surgeon.webp","00_attachments/classimages/rogue-tamaya.webp"],"createdTime":1753285514638,"modifiedTime":1765273512861,"sourceSize":24049,"sourcePath":"94_Character_Creation/Classes and Subclasses/Rogue.md","exportPath":"94_character_creation/classes-and-subclasses/rogue.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":278,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"94_character_creation/classes-and-subclasses/sorcerer.html":{"title":"Sorcerer","icon":"","description":"<a href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se?query=tag:TheGriffonsSaddlebag_BookOne\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#TheGriffonsSaddlebag_BookOne\">#TheGriffonsSaddlebag_BookOne</a><br>\n<img alt=\"00_attachments/ClassImages/Sorcerer - Frost Magic.webp\" src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/classimages/sorcerer-frost-magic.webp\" target=\"_self\">A sorcerer’s magic comes from within, drawing from a genetic or given boon. These mighty spellcasters grow in power in startling ways, and can twist and reshape the fabric of magic around them. A sorcerer may struggle to keep their own power in check, but many would agree that the ends justify the dangers placed upon them. While the mantle of ‘sorcerer’ is thrust upon all sorcerers, their origins are often unique. Your magic is created by pieces of the Everheart, the center and driving force behind the expanding Everglacier wastelands. This power within you might be passed down through ancestors who protected the glacier’s magical core, or it might have been forced upon you through a chance encounter with the enchanted ice itself. Regardless of the source of your power, you are a creature of cold incarnate. 1st-level Frost Magic Feature\nStarting at 1st level, your skin takes on a faintly ice-like, crystalline glow. Your hit point maximum increases by 1 and increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class.In addition, you’re most comfortable in the ice and snow. You ignore difficult terrain created by ice or snow, and when you walk on ice, you only spend 1 foot of movement for every 2 feet you move.1st-level Frost Magic Feature\nAt 1st level, you can use a bonus action to turn up to 5 contiguous 5-foot spaces on the ground into icy terrain, originating from the ground at your feet. The ice is difficult terrain and lasts until the end of your next turn.You can spend up to 2 sorcery points when creating this terrain to increase the number of spaces you can target with this feature by 5 for each sorcery point spent. 6th-level Frost Magic Feature\nAt 6th level, you gain resistance to cold damage. When you deal cold damage to a Large or smaller creature with a spell, you can spend 1 or more sorcery points to attempt to freeze it in place. When you do, that creature’s speed is reduced by 15 feet for each sorcery point you spend until the end of its next turn. If you reduce a creature’s speed to 0 in this way, it takes 2d6 cold damage.In addition, you can now use your Create Ice feature to freeze water as well as ground.14th-level Frost Magic Feature\nBy 14th level, you’re most confident on the ice. Your movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks while you’re walking on icy terrain.In addition, when a creature within 5 feet of you that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to release a blast of freezing cold, dealing cold damage to the attacker equal to half your sorcerer level + your Charisma modifier. When you do, you can also create up to 5 contiguous spaces of icy terrain, originating from the ground at your feet. This icy terrain lasts until the end of your next turn.Frozen Soul\n18th-level Frost Magic Feature\nAt 18th level, you gain immunity to cold damage and resistance to fire damage.You also learn the wall of ice spell. The spell counts as a sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn’t count against the number of sorcerer spells you know. In addition, you can cast it once without expending a spell slot. When you do, the panels of ice created by the spell don’t need to be contiguous with one another. Once you cast the spell in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.<br><a href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se?query=tag:HelianasGuideToMonsterHunting\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#HelianasGuideToMonsterHunting\">#HelianasGuideToMonsterHunting</a><br>\n<img alt=\"Sorcerer - Skinshifter.webp\" src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/classimages/sorcerer-skinshifter.webp\" target=\"_self\">\nWhether it be some distant doppelganger heritage or over-exposure to biomantic magic, your body thrums with the potential for change. Though you may try to channel that power into those around you, the magic that inoculates your body is just as likely to change you, transforming you into a myriad of magical morphs. Will you end up with two left feet and paper-thin skin, or rake through your enemies with toxic claws as spells bounce off of your reflective carapace?1st-level Skinshifter feature\nYou learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Skinshifter Spells table. Each of these spells counts as a sorcerer spell for you, but don’t count against the number of sorcerer spells you know. Whenever you gain a sorcerer level, you can replace one spell you gained from this feature with another spell of the same level. The new spell must be a biomancy or transmutation spell from the sorcerer, warlock, or wizard spell lists.1st-level Skinshifter feature\nYour spellcasting stimulates the latent changeability of your body. Immediately after you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher, roll a d20. If the result is equal to or lower than one-third of your sorcerer level (minimum 1), roll on the Skinshift Adaptations table to magically alter your body in a random way until the end of your next turn. Immediately after you roll on this table, you can spend 1 sorcery point (no action required) to extend the duration of the effect to 10 minutes. If an effect calls for a saving throw, the DC equals your sorcerer spell save DC.**You can only benefit from one of these adaptations at a time. If you gain one of these adaptations while you already benefit from one, the older one is lost.\n+You can only benefit from one of these adaptations at a time. If you gain one of these adaptations while you already benefit from one, the older one is lost.Modify Shift. When you reach 6th level in this\nclass, you can add a bonus to the result of the d20\nyou roll on the Skinshift Adaptations table equal\nto up to half your sorcerer level. For example, at\n6th level, if you rolled a 19 on the d20, you could\nchoose any result between 19 and 22.6th-level Skinshifter feature\nAs a bonus action, you can spend 1 or more sorcery points to magically transform your body for the next 10 minutes. For each sorcery point you spend, you gain one adaptation of your choice from the Skinshift Adaptations table, the effects of which last until the transformation ends. The adaptation must have a value in the d20 column equal to or lower than 20 plus half your sorcerer level. If you gain a random skinshift adaptation that replaces one you already had (for example, tumour skin replacing rubber skin), this new adaptation lasts for the duration of the transformation.14th-level Skinshifter feature\nImmediately after you take damage, you can use your reaction to spend 1 sorcery point and gain resistance to that damage type for 10 minutes or until you use this feature again. If you take multiple types of damage simultaneously, you choose one of the damage types to gain resistance to.18th-level Skinshifter feature\nYou unleash your inner shapeshifter, allowing your body to react to all manner of environmental\nstimuli. As bonus action, you can cause a metabolic cascade that transforms your body for 10 minutes, granting you the following effects: All grapple and restraining effects on you immediately end.\nYou gain six adaptations of your choice from the Skinshift Adaptations table. For these, you ignore the restrictions on which adaptations you can have simultaneously.\nYou can’t use the Reactive Mutations or Selective Shift skinshifter features, and it ends if it is active.\nImmediately after you take damage, you gain resistance to that damage type. You can simultaneously sustain three damage resistances in this way; if you gain another resistance from this feature while at your limit, the oldest one is lost. After you activate this feature, you can’t do so\nagain until you finish a long rest.Looking for inspiration to describe how a skinshifter’s reactive mutations might physically manifest? Try adapting the following examples!\nBludgeoning. Spongy growths bloom, cushioning the blows of impact weapons.\nPiercing. Layer upon layer of pointy membranes overlap one another, dispersing the penetrating potential of piercing weapons.\nSlashing. A hard coating of angled crystal deflects blades.\nAcid. Secreted alkaline liquid neutralises acid near the skin.\nCold &amp; Fire. An insulating gel prevents the transfer of heat.\nForce. Pockets of antimagic dissipate incoming raw, magical energy.\nLightning. Channels of conductive metals in the skin ground the flow of electricity.\nNecrotic. Pus-filled sacs of immunity-enhancing symbionts fortify the skinshifter against decay.\nRadiant. The skinshifter takes on a brilliant sheen, reflecting radiation of all descriptions.\nThunder. A membrane expands out from the skinshifter’s skin. A low-pressure void between the two membranes inhibits the propagation of sound waves.\nPoison. Vesicles rapidly excrete toxins before they can do significant harm.\nPsychic. A rush of bright purple hormones causes the skinshifter’s psyche to relax, shedding the mental harm that might have been caused.\n<br><a href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se?query=tag:TheGriffonsSaddlebag_BookTwo\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#TheGriffonsSaddlebag_BookTwo\">#TheGriffonsSaddlebag_BookTwo</a><br>\n<img alt=\"Sorcerer - Desert Soul.webp\" src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/classimages/sorcerer-desert-soul.webp\" target=\"_self\">\nSome mages draw on their their magic like a fountain from within. This wellspring of power can come from a unique origin, mysterious birthright, or simple chance of fate. Whatever your story may be, you are steeped in magic, and it is yours to control.Your power comes from the relentless and punishing magic that lies at the heart of the world’s most unforgiving deserts. Most sorcerers with this power were born to nomads or traveling pilgrims in the H’rethi desert, but perhaps yours came to you in the chaos of a raging sandstorm or the springs of a magical oasis. Regardless of its origin, this blistering magic spirals around inside of you in an ever-present storm that can reduce even the sturdiest enemies to rubble1st-level Desert Soul feature\nStarting when you choose this origin at 1st level, you ignore difficult terrain created by sand, and you can tolerate temperatures as high as 150 degrees Fahrenheit without any additional protection.1st-level Desert Soul feature\nStarting at 1st level, you can cause the magical sand- storm within you to manifest as a nearby twister. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher on your turn, you can use a bonus action to create this storm in a 5-foot cube in a space you can see within 30 feet of you. A Large or smaller creature in the area must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your sorcerer spell save DC. A creature that fails the saving throw is pushed up to 10 feet in a direction of your choice if it’s Medium or smaller, or 5 feet if it’s Large.When you reach 6th level in this class, a creature that fails this saving throw also takes either 1d8 bludgeoning damage or 1d8 fire damage (your choice). The damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 2d8 at 14th level, and 3d8 at 18th level6th-level Desert Soul feature\nAt 6th level, you learn the mirror image spell. If you already know this spell, you learn a different sorcerer spell of your choice. The spell doesn’t count against your number of spells known. You can cast it by spending 2 sorcery points or by expending a spell slot. If you cast it with sorcery points, any creature within 10 feet of you that destroys one of the spell’s illusions takes fire damage equal to half your sorcerer level, as the illusion bursts into a wave of scalding air and sand.14th-level Desert Soul feature\nBeginning at 14th level, you have the ability to step into the heart of the twisters you create. Immediately after a creature is pushed by your Sandstorm feature, you can spend 2 sorcery points to teleport to the storm’s space.\nYou can also teleport in this way if you create the storm in a space that is unoccupied. When you teleport in this way, you and any equipment you are wearing or carrying are invisible until the end of your turn.18th-level Desert Soul feature\nAt 18th level, you can become as intangible as sand. You can spend 5 sorcery points as a bonus action to magically transform yourself into a sand-like form. In this form, you have the following benefits:\nYou can’t be grappled.\nYou and any equipment you are wearing or carrying can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch without squeezing.\nYou can move through the space of any creature, regardless of its size, and difficult terrain doesn’t cost you extra movement. In addition, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to turn to sand. Until the end of that turn, you have resistance to all damage, including against the triggering attack. You remain in this form for 1 minute. It ends early if you are incapacitated, if you die, or if you dismiss it as a bonus action.<br><a href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se?query=tag:RyokosGuideToTheYokaiRealms\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#RyokosGuideToTheYokaiRealms\">#RyokosGuideToTheYokaiRealms</a><br>\n<img alt=\"Sorcerer - Spirit Caller.webp\" src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/classimages/sorcerer-spirit-caller.webp\" target=\"_self\">\nLegends tell that a Spirit Caller is born when the soul of a yokai and humanoid meet in the misty void that holds minds waiting to be given life. Spirit Callers are able to manifest their willpower and vitality as a spectral being, a wraith-like spirit that emerges from their body to strike at their enemies. The bond between caller and spirit is visceral; in response to its caller’s fury, a spirit might detonate a blast of necrotic energy, magnify its size, or hone its senses. A Spirit Caller is the epitome of self-reliance and personal strength, their soul and willpower manifested as a being of its own.1st-Level Spirit Caller Feature\nYou learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Spirit Caller Spells table. Each of these spells counts as a sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn’t count against the number of sorcerer spells you know. Whenever you gain a sorcerer level, you can replace one spell you gained from this feature with another spell of the same level. The new spell must be an illusion or a conjuration spell from the sorcerer, warlock, or wizard spell list.1st-Level Spirit Caller Feature\nYou can use an action to manifest your spirit, which appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you. It uses the manifested spirit stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places. You decide the appearance your manifested spirit takes. For example, your spirit might appear as a shadowy clone of you, a vicious dragon, or a mighty, sword-wielding specter that crackles with fiery energy. No matter the form your spirit takes, its statistics remain the same.While manifested, your spirit shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. As a bonus action, you can command it to take the Attack action on its next turn; otherwise, it takes the Dodge or Help action (your choice). Your spirit remains manifested for 10 minutes, until it is reduced to 0 hit points, or until you lose your concentration, as if concentrating on a spell. You add your Charisma modifier to saving throws you make to maintain concentration on your manifested spirit. After this time, your spirit retreats back into you and disappears.You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short rest or long rest.6th-Level Spirit Caller Feature\nSpells you cast that don’t have a range of self can originate from your manifested spirit, instead of you, if it is within 120 feet of you.6th-Level Spirit Caller Feature\nWhen you manifest your spirit using your Conduit of the Soul feature, you can expend any number of sorcery points. When you do, choose one boon from the following list for each point you expend. Your manifested spirit gains these boons until it disappears. You can’t select the same boon more than once at the same time, unless stated otherwise.\nResistance\nYour spirit gains resistance to one damage type of your choice. You can select this boon up to a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus.\nExtended Stay\nThe maximum amount of time your spirit can remain manifested increases by 10 minutes. You can select this boon up to a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus.\nEnlarge\nYour spirit’s size increases by one category. Its reach increases by 5 feet, and its melee attacks deal an extra 1d8 damage of the attack’s type on a hit.\nTeleporter\nYour spirit can use its bonus action to teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.\nFrenzy\nYour spirit has advantage on all melee attack rolls, but attack rolls made against it have advantage.\nDetonator\nWhen your spirit is reduced to 0 hit points or you lose concentration on it, each creature of your choice within 20 feet of it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your sorcerer spell save DC or take necrotic or radiant damage (your choice on detonation) equal to 2d10 + your sorcerer level.\nOf One Mind\nYou can use a bonus action to see through your spirit’s eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.\nDevil’s Sight\nYour spirit can see in dim light and darkness, both magical and nonmagical, to a distance of 120 feet.\nEnhanced Agility\nYour spirit’s speed is doubled.\nBattlefield Squire\nAfter your spirit takes the Help action, it can use a bonus action on that turn to take the Disengage or Dodge action.\n14th-Level Spirit Caller Feature\nWhen you use a bonus action to command your spirit on the same turn it’s summoned, you can have it take one additional action on its first turn.In addition, you gain any damage resistances that your manifested spirit has for the duration of its manifestation.18th-Level Spirit Caller Feature\nYou no longer need to maintain your concentration on your manifested spirit. You can cause it to disappear at any time (no action required).You imbue your spirit with further power. When you manifest your spirit, you can choose one additional boon without spending a sorcery point to gain it. In addition, when summoned, you can choose for your spirit’s base size to be Medium or Large.

Beaming from ear to ear, a chemical-stained gnome admires her handiwork amongst the clutter of her laboratory: a ‘snektopus’; eight venom-fanged maws perfectly spliced with the intelligence of a cephalopod.Coughing in the smoking ruins of the cultists’ former hideout, a tiefling gives their fire-infused owlbear a playful rub behind the ears, contemplating a job well done and the rewards to be claimed.Whether imbuing their companions with the primordial elements, enhancing them through the ‘very tiny stitches’ of biomancy, or inciting them with words of encouragement, tamers work through their captured friends. Alone, a tamer possesses little in the way of destructive ability. With carefully selected companions, a tamer can become an unstoppable menagerie of mayhem. What prompted you to begin taming creatures? Loneliness? A need to transport your favourite dragonling through customs? A pathological desire to catch ‘em all?The bond tamers experience with their companions are incredibly intimate; both are privy to the other’s innermost thoughts. However, such bondsdiffer between tamers: where one tamer might view a companion as friend and equal, another might view the creature as a tool with which to fulfill their own goals. Have you lost a companion before? How did you react? Perhaps it was emotionally traumatising, or perhaps it was simply a mere inconvenience.You can make a tamer by following this suggestion: Choose Wisdom, Intelligence, or Charisma to be your highest ability score, followed by ConstitutionHit Dice: 1d8 per tamer level\nHit Points at 1st Level: 8 + your Constitution modifier\nHit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per tamer level after 1stArmor: Light armor, medium armor, shields\nWeapons: Simple weapons, nets\nTools: One type of artisan’s tools or one musical instrument of your choice\nSaving Throws: Constitution, Charisma\nSkills: Choose two from Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Nature, Perception, and PersuasionYou start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:\n(a) scale mail or (b) leather armor\nA simple melee weapon, a net, and a shield\nA light crossbow and 20 bolts\n(a) a dungeoneer’s pack or (b) an explorer’s pack\nIf you forgo this starting equipment, as well as the items offered by your background, you start with 5d4 × 10 gp to buy your equipment.\nIf using the optional rule on multiclassing, use the following prerequisites, proficiencies, and spell slots if you choose the tamer as one of your classes. Ability Score Minimum: As a multiclass character, you must have at least an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score of 13 to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you’re already a tamer. The ability you use to qualify to multiclass into tamer must be your tamer spellcasting ability.Proficiencies Gained. If tamer isn’t your initial class, you gain the following proficiencies when you take your first level as a tamer: light armour, shields, simple weapons, and nets.Spell Slots. Add half your levels (rounded down) in the tamer class to the appropriate levels from other classes to determine your available spell slots.You become bonded to a companion that accompanies you on your adventures and is trained to fight alongside you. Choose a Small or smaller creature with a challenge rating of 1/2 or lower that isn’t a humanoid, giant, or swarm to become your companion. When a creature becomes your companion, it has a maximum number of hit points equal to the average of its Hit Dice, as indicated in its statistics, and it can’t cast spells. Work with your GM to find a companion that suits your campaign world. This companion obeys your commands and is friendly to you and your allies. Vessel. When not summoned, your companion exists inside a magical vessel of your own design, such as a painted animal skull, bejewelled egg, or crystal sphere. While in this vessel, the companion has full cover from all attacks and other effects, is unaffected by area of effects that originate from outside the vessel, and exists in stasis; it doesn’t need to eat, drink, sleep, or breathe, and it is immune to poison and disease, although a poison or disease already in its system is suspended, not neutralised. A companion at 0 hit points is instantly stabilised when it enters its vessel. If a vessel is broken, or a companion is released from its vessel for any other reason, the creature within it ceases to be a tamer’s companion. It acts according to its own wishes and retains any improvements it gained while a companion.Summoning. As an action, you can summon your companion from a vessel, causing it to appear in an unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet of you, or any unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. You can dismiss a companion within 30 feet of you as a bonus action or action, drawing it back into its vessel. To summon or dismiss a companion, you must be holding its vessel in hand. You can only have one companion summoned at a time.Combat. In combat, your companion shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action or action on your turn to command it to take different actions. Those actions can be in its statistics or some other action, bonus action, or object interaction. If you are incapacitated, the companion can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge. Your companion can’t take the Multiattack action until you reach 5th level in this class, even if it would otherwise be able to. Rest. A companion gains the benefits of a long rest when its tamer finishes a long rest; if it has at least 1 hit point, it regains all its hit points when you finish a long rest. Unlike other creatures, a companion can’t spend its own Hit Dice to recover hit points at the end of a short rest. See the Soul Bond feature for details on recovering hit points.Items. Armour, barding, and weapons can be equipped to enhance your companion. A companion can wear or carry any equipment that their size and body shape permits. However, your companion must be proficient with the armour or weapon to make full use of it. If your companion wears armour that it lacks proficiency with, it has disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity. A companion that is not proficient with a weapon type does not add its proficiency bonus to attack rolls made with that weapon typeItem Bonding. Over the course of an hour, you can bond a companion to one object that it can wear or carry that is not any sort of container or storage. When a companion is recalled, all items it is wearing or carrying that it is not bonded to are dropped in the space from which it was recalled. A companion can be bonded to up to 3 items at any one time. Companions can’t attune to magic items, unless they have a specific ability that allows them to do so (e.g. Proto-Attunement, page 238).Companion Barding. You can purchase armour for your companion. Any type of armour can be purchased as barding. The cost and weight is doubled for each size category above Medium, and halved for each size category below Small. In addition, the cost is further doubled if the companion is not humanoid in shape.1st-level Tamer feature\nCompanions make death saving throws, die, and can be revived like any player character. A companion that has been stabilised remains unconscious until it regains hit points, or until you finish a long rest. Companions that are stable and have 0 hit points when you finish a long rest regain half their maximum hit points. You have a pool of healing power equal to five times your tamer level that replenishes when you finish a long rest. Whenever you finish a short rest, you can choose to draw power from that pool, restoring a total number of hit points amongst your companions up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool.1st-level Tamer feature\nAs you gain levels in this class, your companions become more powerful. Your companions use your proficiency bonus instead of their own, potentially increasing their attack, saving throw, and skill modifiers, and their saving throw DCs.Training. Whenever you gain an Ability Score Improvement from gaining a level in the tamer class, you pass on your hardened resolve to all your companions, causing them to gain 1 additional Hit Die. Increase your companion’s hit point maximum by rolling this Hit Die and adding your companion’s Constitution modifier (minimum of 0). Whenever you gain a level beyond 1st in this class, each companion to which you are bonded gains one of the following improvements. The familiars in Chapter 8 have unique improvements that can be taken instead of these.Any newly gained companions receive these additional Hit Dice and improvements as if you had them since your 1st level in tamer.* E.g., a base speed of 30 feet can be increased to 45 feet maximum, a base speed of 25 feet can be increased to 40 feet, and a base speed of 20 feet to 30 feet.\n** Your companions can each benefit from this feature once. When you reach 5th level in this class, your companions can each benefit from this feature twice. When you reach 9th level in this class, your companions can each benefit from this feature three times. This improvement does not affect attacks made with weapons.\n*** Your companion can’t gain proficiency in medium and heavy armour until it has gained proficiency in the prerequisite lighter armour types. For example, to gain proficiency in heavy armour, you must take this improvement 3 times: light, then medium, then heavy. Work with your GM to figure out if and how a creature can wield shields and weapons.*The CR columns in the table: Improvements/Hit Dice Gained on Training***For example, if a 10th level tamer trained a CR 1 creature, that creature would immediately gain 6 improvements (see previous page) and 1 Hit Die. This is indicated by the value ‘6/1’ in the ‘CR 1’ column and the level ‘10’ row.1st-level Tamer feature\nOne way to defeat deadly foes: have deadlier friends. As you explore, you will encounter new creatures which you may wish to make your companions. You can tame a Small or smaller creature of CR ½ or lower, as described below. As you gain levels in this class, the size and challenge rating of creatures you can tame increases, as shown in the Tamer Companion Summary table. Vessel. To tame a companion, you must first prepare a vessel using special inks, gems, or other materials. Preparing the vessel takes 8 hours of work and components with a value in gold pieces equal to at least one hundred times the target creature’s CR.\nVessels and Cost\nAt 4th level, you can capture creatures of CR 1 and below. To capture a CR ½ or CR 1 creature, you need a vessel worth 50 gp or 100 gp, respectively. If you try to use a vessel worth 50 gp to capture a CR 1 creature, the creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw, and the vessel can be recovered. You can always break down the components of an old vessel to craft a new one as part of the vessel preparation process. You can release a companion from a vessel at any point. The vessel remains intact, and can be used to tame a new creature.\nTaming a Creature. As an action, you can throw an empty vessel at a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw against your tamer spell save DC or be trapped within the vessel. A creature automatically succeeds on this saving throw if: It is a humanoid, giant, or swarm.\nIt is larger than your maximum companion size (use a creature’s unaltered size if it is under the influence of a size-changing magical effect, such as enlarge/reduce).\nIt has a higher CR than your maximum companion CR (see the Tamer Companion Summary table).\nIt has a higher CR than the vessel can capture.\nIt has more than half of its hit points.\nIf a creature doesn’t automatically succeed on this saving throw for one of the above reasons, and has either fewer than ten hit points or one-quarter of its hit points, it automatically fails this saving throw. A creature that fails the saving throw is trapped in your vessel and becomes your companion when you next finish a long rest.Lost Traits. When a creature becomes your companion, it loses the following from its stat block:\nThe ability to cast any spells (though it retains its spells known, see Psychic Bond, page 201).\nAny summoning actions or actions that create additional creatures (such as a wraith’s Create Specter action or an ooze’s Split reaction).\nThe Regeneration, Rejuvenation, and Legendary Resistance traits.\nAny effect that restores hit points, unless that effect has a limited number of uses per day.\nAny legendary actions, mythic traits, legendary action options, and mythic action options.\nAny lair actions and regional effects. Abilities and Proficiency\nAs your companions’ ability scores change—often through Companion Improvement Training—their skill modifiers, saving throws, attack modifiers, and saving throw DCs will also change. Working out what ability a creature’s attack or saving throw uses can require a bit of detective work.\nFirst you have to know the creature’s proficiency bonus (PB). Luckily this is quite easy: it all depends on the creature’s CR and players’ PB. A creatures’ base PB is +2 at CR 0-4 and +3 at CR 5-6. To proceed, subtract the creature’s PB from its modifiers/save DCs. For save DCs, subtract an additional 8 from the DC. Finally, match the remaining values to the ability score modifiers.\nLet’s use the CR 4 red dragon wyrmling’s bite attack and breath weapon as an example. It has a PB of +2, a Strength of 19 (+4), a Dexterity of 10 (+0), and a Constitution of 17 (+3). Its bite attack has a +6 modifier, while its breath weapon has a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. Subtracting the PB from these values (and 8 from the DC), we are left with +4 and DC 3. We can deduce that the bite attack uses Strength (the +4 matches the wyrmling’s Strength modifier), and the fire breath uses Constitution (DC 3 matches the wyrmling’s +3 Constitution modifier).\nIf the wyrmling’s tamer is 13th level (with a PB of +5), then the wyrmling’s PB increases from +2 to +5 when it becomes a companion. This results in its attack modifier and save DC increasing to +9 and DC 16, respectively.\n2nd-level Tamer feature\nBy 2nd level, you have learned to harness your mental fortitude to augment the potential of others. You can cast tamer spells. See page 495 for the tamer spell list.At 2nd level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the tamer spell list. You learn additional tamer cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Tamer table.The Tamer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your tamer spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these tamer spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. For example, if you know the 1st-level spell animal friendship and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast animal friendship using either slot. You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the tamer spell list.The Spells Known column of the Tamer table shows when you learn more tamer spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the tamer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the tamer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.When you gain your first level in this class, choose whether you use your knowledge (Intelligence), willpower (Wisdom), or force of personality (Charisma) as your spellcasting ability for your tamer spells. You use this spellcasting ability whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your spellcasting ability modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a tamer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\nSpell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your spellcasting ability modifier Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your spellcasting ability modifier\nYou can use a creature’s vessel as a spellcasting focus for your tamer spells.Some monster features are very powerful, and aren’t designed for use by players. The two most common are recharge actions and gazes. You can help make a companion more balanced by changing these features slightly. It’s advised to approach this on a case-by-case basis, as each feature is different, and some might not require changing.Recharge Abilities.\nSome creatures’ actions have the addendum “Recharge (5-6)”. This means that after a creature uses that action, it can’t use it again until it has recharged. At the start of the creature’s turn, you roll a d6, and if the result is a 5 or higher, the action recharges. No class has recharge abilities, in part because they add a lot of randomness to the game. Instead of using this recharge mechanic, you can simply change any ability with a recharge to one of the following:Perpetually Active Abilities.\nSome traits, like a medusa’s Petrifying Gaze, which is perpetually active and has the power of a 6th level spell, have the potential to become overpowered and repetitive. To balance this, you can add the caveat that “after a creature makes a saving throw against this effect, it is immune to the effect for the next 24 hours”. Work with your GM to find a balanced solution for your game.2nd-level Tamer feature\nWhile your companion is within 100 feet of you and you are holding its vessel, or if you are holding its vessel with it inside, you can use an action to expend one spell slot to restore hit points to your companion equal to your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum 1) plus an additional 2d4 per level of the spell slot expended.2nd-level Tamer feature\nWhile your companion is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, as an action, you can see through your companion’s eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the companion has. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.Spell Swap. While your companion is summoned, is within 100 feet of you, and you hold its vessel, any spells your companion knows are added to your known spells. In addition, when you cast a spell with a range of self or touch, your companion can be the target of that spell.3rd-level Tamer feature\nAs you gain levels in this class, the number of companions and maximum size of companion to which you can become bonded increases. You can be bonded to two, three, four, five, or six creatures at 3rd, 7th, 11th, 15th, and 19th level, respectively. Your companions can be sized Medium at 5th level, Large at 11th level, and Huge at 17th level. If you are already bonded to your maximum number of companions and become bonded to a new companion, you must choose one existing companion to release from its vessel.When you bond with a new companion, the companion gains improvements and Hit Dice based on its CR and your tamer level. See the Tamer Companion Summary table (page 198) for details. 3rd-level Tamer feature\nYou choose the type of Training Paradigm you follow from the list of available paradigms, which are detailed after the class’s description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 10th, and 14th level. At 18th level, the 7th-level feature is improved.4th-level Tamer feature\nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.5th-level Tamer feature\nThrough rigorous training, you can access the innate fury of your companions. When you take a bonus action or action to command your companion, you can command it to use its Multiattack action, if it has one.5th-level Tamer feature\nWhile your companion is within 100 feet of you, you can order it to change its behaviour towards one creature you can see as part of the bonus action or action you use to command it. Choose either the aggressive or cautious behaviours. At the start of each of the target creature’s turns for the next minute, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw versus your tamer spell save DC if it is within 30 feet of your companion and can see your companion. On a failure, it suffers the effects of the associated behaviour until the start of its next turn. On a success, it is unaffected.\nAggressive. The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls it makes against creatures other than your companion.\nCautious. The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against your companion if there is another creature hostile towards the attacker within 5 feet of the attacker.\nAfter you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest. 6th-level Tamer feature\nWhile summoning a companion, your psychic connection is at its closest, allowing you to quickly relay your intent. As part of the action to summon a companion, you can command it to take an action in its stat block or some other action, which it does so on its turn. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your tamer spellcasting ability modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses of this feature when you finish a long rest.6th-level Tamer feature\nYour magical potency is channeled through your companions’ strikes. Your companions’ attacks count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.13th-level Tamer feature\nYou learn how to switch places with your companion in the nick of time. While you and your companion are within 100 feet of each other, you can use a bonus action, or a reaction when you or your companion is the target of an attack by an attacker you can see, to magically switch places with your companion. If performed as a reaction, the creature that appears in the targeted creature’s space becomes the new target of the attack. You have a number of uses of this feature equal to your tamer spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.17th-level Tamer feature\nWhile your companion is within 100 feet of you, you can order it to change its behaviour as part of the bonus action or action you use to command it. Choose either the provoking poise or shrinking violet behaviours.\nProvoking Poise. For the next minute, your companion draws the attention of nearby creatures. While within 15 feet of your companion, any creature that is hostile towards your companion and that can see it has disadvantage on attack rolls it makes against creatures other than your companion.\nShrinking Violet. For the next minute, your companion appears small and unassuming, making little noise. Any creature that is hostile towards your companion has disadvantage on attack rolls against your companion if there is another creature hostile towards the attacker within 15 feet of the attacker.\nAfter you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.20th-level Tamer feature\nIn times of great need, a tamer can summon many of its companions simultaneously. As an action, you can summon additional companions which remain summoned for 1 minute. You can have a maximum of three companions summoned simultaneously as a result of using this feature.As an action on subsequent turns, you can issue mental commands to all your companions at once, allowing them to take an action in their stat block or some other action. You choose the order in which your companions act each round. After the minute elapses, all your companions bar one (which you choose) return to their vessels and a wave of lethargy sweeps over you; you can’t move or take actions until the end of your next turn. Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.<br><img alt=\"00_attachments/ClassImages/Tamer - Leader.webp\" src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/classimages/tamer-leader.webp\" target=\"_self\">\nWhether it be through a non-stop litany of encouraging aphorisms, exaggerated movements, and hands signals, or through a calm, telepathic reinforcement, a leader exhorts their companions to ever greater feats of brilliance. Leaders believe that with the right support and teamwork, no task is impossible for their menagerie of companions. Whether you swear by positive reinforcement, craft meticulous pre-fight gameplans, or ruthlessly punish mistakes, communication and motivation are your watchwords.3rd-level Leader feature\nAs an action, you can inspire your companion through shouts, gestures, and mental encouragement. Until the beginning of your next turn, whenever your companion makes a saving throw or attack roll, it can add a d6 to its result.You can use this feature a number of times equal to your tamer spellcasting ability modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.The die you grant when you use this feature changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 6th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 14th level.3rd-level Leader feature\nYou learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Leader Spells table. Each spell counts as a tamer spell for you, but it doesn’t count against the number of tamer spells you know.7th-level Leader feature\nYou can push your companion beyond its normal limits for a moment. When you use an action or bonus action to command your companion, you can extol it to exert greater effort. On your companion’s turn, it can take one additional action of your choice.Once your companion has benefited from your use of this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before that same companion can benefit from it again. Starting at 18th level, your companions can benefit from Action Burst twice before a rest, but only once on the same turn.10th-level Leader feature\nWhen an attacker that you can see hits your companion with an attack, you can use both your and your companion’s reactions to bolster its resilience. Your companion fortifies itself, halving the attack’s damage against it.14th-level Leader feature\nAs an action, you can summon a second companion from a vessel you are holding to an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet of you. When you use an action or bonus action to command your companion, you can command both of them simultaneously, giving a different command to each.The two companions take their turns in an order of your choice, directly after your turn. At the start of their turns, you can mentally choose one creature you can see (no action required). If your first companion makes an attack against the chosen target, the second companion gains advantage on its attack rolls against this creature until the end of its turn.After being summoned for 1 minute, or if your second companion is ever more than 100 feet away from you, the second companion is dismissed. Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.<br><img alt=\"00_attachments/ClassImages/Tamer - Infuser.webp\" src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/classimages/tamer-infuser.webp\" target=\"_self\">\nInfusers meld the power of the elements with their companions through the act of summoning. How you came across this power is anyone’s guess. Perhaps you took a tumble across the Elemental Flux during an inter-planar voyage, were born with some primordial heritage, or were tutored by an elementalist wizard. However it happened, you have the ability to empower those with which you are most closely bonded: your companions.3rd-level Infuser feature\nYou have a deep connection with the elements and can infuse your companions with primordial energy. When you finish a long rest, you can choose one of the following elements with which to individually infuse each of your companions: acid, cold, fire, or lightning. When you do so, any previous infusion on those companions end. The first time your companion hits a target with an attack on its turn, it deals 1d4 additional damage of the infused type.This damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class: 1d6 at 6th level, 1d8 at 10th level, and 1d10 at 14th level.3rd-level Infuser feature\nYou learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Infuser Spells table. Each spell counts as a tamer spell for you, but it doesn’t count against the number of tamer spells you know.7th-level Infuser feature\nYour companions gain the ability to unleash a torrent of elemental energy in a devastating blow. When you infuse a companion at the end of a long rest, it gains an action option corresponding to the chosen element. The DC for the saving throw equals your tamer spell save DC.\nAcid: Caustic Mist. Your companion disperses an acidic vapour into a 20-foot cube originating from it that lasts for 1 minute, or until dispersed by a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour). Each other creature that starts its turn in the area must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 4d4 acid damage on a failure, or half as much damage on a success.\nCold: Snap Freeze. Your companion absorbs the heat in a 10-foot-radius sphere around it. Each other creature in the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d8 cold damage and its speed is halved until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and its speed isn’t affected.\nFire: Flametongue. Your companion unleashes a raging inferno in a 25-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d6 fire damage on a failure, or half as much damage on a success. The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried.\nLightning: Sparkstep. Your companion discharges lightning in a 10-foot-radius sphere centred on itself. Each other creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 4d6 lightning damage and it can’t take reactions until the start of its next turn. On a success, it takes half as much damage and can take reactions as normal. After the saving throws are resolved, your companion can immediately fly up to 30 feet as part of this action.\nOnce a companion uses one of these actions, it can’t use any action granted by this feature again until you finish a short or long rest. Starting at 18th level, a companion can use this action twice before a rest, but only once on the same turn.10th-level Infuser feature\nYour companion gains resistance to the element with which it is infused. When your companion takes damage of that type, you can use your reaction to bolster its defences, granting it immunity to that damage type, including against the triggering damage, until the start of your next turn. Once you use this reaction, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.14th-level Infuser feature\nSometimes, more is better. As an action, you can infuse your companion with a second element for 1 minute, choosing from the options in the Infuse feature. Your companion gains the benefits of the Infuse, Elemental Discharge, and Primordial Shield features for both of the elements with which it is infused. If you activate your Primordial Shield feature while Unstable Fusion is active, your companion gains immunity to both damage types. Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.<br><img alt=\"00_attachments/ClassImages/Tamer - Necromancer.webp\" src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/classimages/tamer-necromancer.webp\" target=\"_self\">\nWhether through the tutelage of a lich, a career as a gravedigger, or an innate affinity for the world beyond, you have learnt to manipulate the very essence of life. You can strip it from those that would do you harm, and imbue it in those that serve your aims. Weaving threads of necromantic magic around bone, flesh, and sinew, you create gruesome facsimiles of life—undead puppets that move to the rhythm of the threads you pull.3rd-level Necromancer feature\nYour command of necromantic magic and affinity for the no-longer-living allows you to drain your companions’ life force, converting it into a temporary boon. Once per turn, when your companion hits a creature with an attack, you can mentally command the companion to shed some of its life force (no action required). Your companion takes 1d4 necrotic damage that can’t be reduced in any way, gains an equal number of temporary hit points, and deals an equal amount of necrotic damage to its target. This damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class: 1d6 at 6th level, 1d8 at 10th level, and 1d10 at 14th level. 3rd-level Necromancer feature\nDeath is no barrier to your taming magic. You can attempt to tame one creature within 1 minute of it dying, adhering to the normal rules for taming a new companion, with the following changes:\nWhen you attempt to tame a dead creature, its soul makes a Charisma saving throw against your tamer spell save DC.\nHumanoids and giants don’t automatically succeed on this saving throw.\nOn a failure, the creature’s soul becomes bound to its body; its type changes to undead and it becomes one of your companions.\nOn a success, you fail to tame the creature and you can’t attempt to tame the creature again until it has been brought back to life by other means\n3rd-level Necromancer feature\nYou learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Necromancer Spells table. Each spell counts as a tamer spell for you, but it doesn’t count against the number of tamer spells you know.7th-level Necromancer feature\nYou learn how to use your taming magic to temporarily raise new allies and bind them to your will. You learn the animate dead spell, you always have it prepared, it doesn’t count against the number of spells you know, and you can cast it once without using a spell slot. After you do so, you can’t cast it in this way again until you finish a long rest.Once you reach 18th level, when you cast this spell using this feature, the creature you animate has the statistics of a ghast (if Medium or smaller corpse) or a minotaur skeleton (if Large or larger corpse). When you reassert your control over these creatures, you can maintain control of only 1 creature per casting of the spell, instead of 4. When you issue a command to your companion using either a bonus action or action, you can issue the same command to any creatures you have created with animate dead so long as the creatures are within 100 feet of you.10th-level Necromancer feature\nYou learn to channel life force between you and your companions. As an action while your summoned companion is within 100 feet of you, you can deal necrotic damage to your companion up to a value equal to twice your tamer level. This damage can’t be reduced in any way. You then regain hit points equal to the damage dealt. Alternatively, you can deal the necrotic damage to yourself and restore hit points to your summoned companion equal to the damage you took. 14th-level Necromancer feature\nAs an action, you tap into deep pools of necromantic energy, imbuing your companion with a 15-foot aura of undeath for the next minute. While imbued with this aura, your companion can, as a bonus action on its turn, force one creature it can see within the aura to make a Constitution saving throw against your tamer spell save DC. On a failure, the creature takes 4d8 necrotic damage and your companion gains a number of temporary hit points equal to half the damage dealt.In addition, for the duration, when your companion would be reduced to 0 hit points, it doesn’t fall unconscious. Instead, it is reduced to 1 hit point and gains one failed death saving throw. If your companion gains three failed death saving throws during the minute, or five failed death saving throws if it has the undead type, it immediately dies. At the end of the minute, your companion drops to 0 hit points, falls unconscious, and is stable.Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.<br><img alt=\"00_attachments/ClassImages/Tamer - Splicer.webp\" src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/classimages/tamer-splicer.webp\" target=\"_self\">\nThrough really tiny stitches, you alter the physiology of your subjec– er… companions, in an unending quest for perfection. Many Splicers delve into the world of adventuring in the hopes of discovering exciting new improvements with which to augment their companions. Your foray into the world of biomancy, whether through wizarding school, working with biosmith artificers, or as the surgical assistant to a mad scientist, has resulted in a singular observation: subjects are much more malleable when they’re psychically bonded to you.3rd-level Splicer feature\nYou can fiddle with the very essence of your companions, crafting minor improvements and modifications. When you choose this paradigm, you gain 3 splicer points. Each time you gain a level in the tamer class, you gain 1 additional splicer point. You can spend these points to modify your companions with the following augments—features and traits that take effect when you next finish a long rest. Splicer points are shared across all your companions. If a companion is ever released, it loses any augments it had and the splicer points are refunded. Augments can be gained only once unless otherwise stated. See the Splicer Augments table on the next page for more details.Surgeon’s Tools. You also gain proficiency with surgeon’s tools (see page 121). You can spend 1 hour removing all augments from one companion with your surgeon’s tools, causing it to lose all the associated effects. You regain all splicer points spent on that companion and can re-allocate those points as you see fit3rd-level Splicer feature\nYou learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Splicer Spells table. Each spell counts as a tamer spell for you, but it doesn’t count against the number of tamer spells you know.7th-level Splicer feature\nYou can upgrade each of your companions with exotic organs and appendages. At the start of a long rest, you can choose one of the following upgrades for each of your companions. At the end of the long rest, the biomantic meld completes, and your companion gains the associated action option. The DC for the saving throw equals your tamer spell save DC.\nCompelling Plumage. Each creature in a 25-foot cone that can see your companion must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by your companion’s dazzling display of colour for the next minute. While charmed in this way, the creature is incapacitated and has a speed of 0 feet. The effect ends for an affected creature if it takes any damage, if someone else uses an action to shake the creature out of its stupor, if it no longer has line of sight to the companion, or is ever more than 25 feet away from the companion.\nPhosphoburst. Each other creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centred on your companion must make a Constitution saving throw against the dizzying burst of light your companion emits. On a failure, a creature takes 2d10 radiant damage and is blinded until the end of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t blinded.\nPoison Web. Your companion launches an unfurling web of sticky silk in a 20-foot cube originating from it. All surfaces in the area become lined with webbing for the next minute. Each creature that touches one of these surfaces for the first time on its turn or starts its turn doing so must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or become restrained for the duration, or until it breaks free. A creature restrained by the webs takes 2d4 poison damage when it becomes restrained and at the start of each of its turns. A creature can use its action to make a Strength check against your tamer spell save DC, freeing itself or another creature restrained by this web on a success.\nSirenshriek. Each other creature in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on your companion must make an Intelligence saving throw as your companion lets forth a brain-curdling mental shriek. On a failure, a creature takes 3d8 psychic damage and, if it is concentrating on a spell, loses its concentration. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and makes saving throws to maintain its concentration as normal.\nOnce a companion uses one of these actions, it can’t do so again until it finishes a short or long rest. Starting at 18th level, a companion can use this action twice before a rest.10th-level Splicer feature\nYou augment your companions with a highly adaptive mutagen, allowing them to gain the strengths of foes they defeat and confer it to your other companions through a synchronous quantum biomantic link. As an action, you can command your companion to consume the corpse of a non-swarm creature that has been dead for less than 1 minute. Choose one of the consumed creature’s damage resistances, damage immunities, or condition immunities (except immunity to exhaustion). All of your companions gain resistance to one damage type to which the slain creature was resistant or immune, or gain immunity to one condition to which the creature was immune. After you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest. When you use this feature again, your companions lose any benefit they had previously gained from this feature.14th-level Splicer feature\nAs an action, you trigger a hidden, internal switch within your companion, triggering a cascade of rapid mutations that lasts for the next minute, with the following results:\nIt immediately grows to Huge size (if it isn’t already).\nIts weight increases by a factor of 8 per size category increased.\nIt gains temporary hit points equal to ten times your tamer level.\nIts Strength score increases to 22 (if it isn’t already higher).\nIt gains proficiency in the Athletics skill.\nIt sprouts an appendage with which it can make melee weapon attacks with a reach of 5 feet that deal bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage (your choice when you take the action) equal to 3d6 plus its Strength modifier (+6) on a hit.\nIt gains the Multiattack action option: The companion makes three attacks with its appendage. After the minute elapses, your companion falls unconscious for 1d4 hours and gains 2 levels of exhaustion.\nOnce you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.\n<br><img alt=\"Splicer Augments Table.webp\" src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/classimages/splicer-augments-table.webp\" target=\"_self\">The creature can breathe only underwater.The creature can breathe air and water.

Through meticulous coaching, they unveil the pugilists within their companions, teaching them to dance between enemies’ strikes, upset their foes’ balance, and finish them with lightning fast combinations. Perhaps you yourself were a master of martial arts, but are now too old to fight. Maybe you grew up watching boxers, but always saw the flaws in their technique. Whatever the case, you are a teacher, and your companions are your eager students.3rd-Level Tamer Feature\nYou teach your companion how to use its body as a deadly weapon. Your companion gains a new attack option: a Martial Strike. Your companion is proficient with this melee attack, which it makes using its body. Your companion can use its choice of Strength or Dexterity when calculating its attack and damage modifiers for this attack, which deals damage of a type (usually bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing) that makes sense for your companion (work with your GM to determine this for each companion). These attacks deal 1d6 damage starting at 3rd level, 1d8 at 7th level, 1d10 at 10th level, and 1d12 at 18th level.When you reach 5th level in this class, your companion can make two Martial Strike attacks when it takes the Attack action on its turn. When you reach 14th level in this class, your companion can make three Martial Strike attacks when it takes the Attack action on its turn.3rd-Level Tamer Feature\nYou learn specific martial techniques, which you teach to each of your companions. Choose three techniques from the Martial Techniques section at the end of this subclass. When you command a companion on your turn, you can instruct it to use one or more of these techniques.When you reach 7th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level in this class, you learn one additional technique that your companions can use.3rd-Level Tamer Feature\nYou learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Sensei Spells table. Each spell counts as a tamer spell for you, but it doesn’t count against the number of tamer spells you know.Sensei Spells\n| Tamer Level | Spells |\n| :---------- | :----- |\n| 3rd | flash*, repulsing palm* |\n| 5th | earthskin*, wind strike* |\n| 9th | create food and water, haste |\n| 13th | freedom of movement, steelskin* |\n| 17th | endure*, greater restoration |\n*See Chapter 13 - Spells7th-Level Tamer Feature\nWith a flourish, your companion can perform a series of complicated martial combinations, flitting between targets with lightning speed. As an action, your companion moves up to its speed (this movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks), and can make up to six Martial Strike attacks, each of which must be against a different target. Until the end of its turn, the companion’s movement does not provoke opportunity attacks.Once a companion uses this action, it can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest. Starting at 18th level, a companion can use this action twice between each of your short or long rests.10th-Level Tamer Feature\nYou have learnt to use your mental connection to shield your companion from pain and fatigue. Whenever your companion takes bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, you can reduce the damage it takes by an amount equal to your tamer spellcasting ability modifier (minimum reduction of 1). You can’t use this feature while you are incapacitated.14th-Level Tamer Feature\nAs an action, you can infuse one summoned companion with your own spirit. For 1 minute, it can make four Martial Strike attacks when it takes the Attack action on its turn instead of three, it can take two bonus actions on each of its turns, and it gains temporary hit points equal to your spellcasting ability modifier at the start of each of its turns.Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.Martial techniques are presented in alphabetical order.As a bonus action, your companion can take the Dodge action.As a reaction when your companion is attacked by a creature it can see and that attack deals bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, your companion can add your proficiency bonus to its AC against that attack, potentially turning a hit into a miss. If the attack still hits, the damage dealt is reduced by an amount equal to 1d6 plus your proficiency bonus.As an action, your companion gains additional movement equal to its speed, and it can make one Martial Strike attack. If your companion moves up to 20 feet straight towards a creature and then hits it with a Martial Strike, the attack deals an extra 1d10 damage, and the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC equals 8 + your companion’s Strength modifier + your proficiency bonus) or be knocked prone. A creature more than one size larger than your companion automatically succeeds on this saving throw.As a bonus action, your companion can take the Disengage action.As a bonus action, your companion can attempt to grapple one creature within its reach by making a grapple check.As a bonus action, your companion can attempt to sweep a creature’s legs (or other anatomy) to knock it prone using the Shoving a Creature rules. The companion can choose to make a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Athletics) check for the contest. A creature more than one size larger than your companion automatically succeeds on this check.Once per turn, when your companion has a creature grappled and takes the Attack action, it can replace one of its attacks with a special melee attack. Instead of an attack roll, it makes a Strength or Dexterity (Athletics) check contested by the target’s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (target’s choice). If your companion succeeds, it can move the creature to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of it and can knock it prone, dealing bludgeoning damage to it equal to two rolls of your companion’s Martial Strikes damage dice.Once per turn, when your companion takes the Attack action, it can replace one of its attacks with a special melee attack, which must be against a prone target. Your companion leaps into the air and places its full bodyweight behind a particularly hard or sharp part of its anatomy. It makes a melee attack roll against the target. The critical hit threshold for this attack is reduced by 1 for each size category that your companion is larger than the target. On a hit, the target takes damage equal to two rolls of your companion’s Martial Strikes damage dice, of the same type as your companion’s Martial Strike attacks. Hit or miss, your companion falls prone.Once per turn, when your companion takes the Attack action, it can replace one of its attacks with a special melee attack, which must be against a target that isn’t prone. It makes a melee attack roll against the target. The critical hit threshold (see page 83) for this attack is reduced by 1 for each size category that your companion is smaller than the target. On a hit, the target takes damage equal to two rolls of your companion’s Martial Strikes damage dice, of the same type as your companion’s Martial Strike attacks.<br><a href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se?query=tag:LArsenesLedger\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#LArsenesLedger\">#LArsenesLedger</a>\nIt takes a malleable and open mind to bond with a swarm of creatures; one needs to tune out the hubbub of bite-sized information and learn to listen to the group as a whole. How did you discover you could control masses of creatures? Perhaps you were a perfumier whose arrangement of scents guided the actions of bees. Maybe you were training as a bard when you found that those who liked your music most were a literal pack of rats. Or maybe you made your clothing a home for a family of creatures who now look to you for leadership. Whatever it is, your command of hordes of creatures gives you the ability to overrun any foe.3rd-Level Swarmslinger Feature\nYou understand the hivemind behaviour of a swarm and can tame swarms of creatures as if they were a single creature using your Tame Creature feature. A creature doesn’t automatically succeed on its Charisma saving throw to avoid becoming your companion as a result of having the swarm type, but all other restrictions still apply. In addition, you can attempt to tame Medium swarms starting at 3rd level.\nUnlike normal swarms, swarms that are your companions can regain hit points and gain temporary hit points. Swarms typically can’t wield weapons, and providing armour for each individual member of a swarm would likely be prohibitively expensive; your GM has the final decision on these matters.3rd-Level Swarmslinger Feature\nWhen it comes to swarms, quantity is better than quality. When your swarm companion makes an attack roll against a creature whose space it is sharing, hit or miss, the attack deals a minimum amount of damage equal to the ability modifier your swarm companion used to make the attack roll plus your proficiency bonus. If the swarm has half its hit points or fewer, this damage is halved. The minimum damage can’t be increased in any way, other than by increasing the ability modifier or your proficiency bonus.3rd-Level Swarmslinger Feature\nYou learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Swarmslinger Spells table. Each spell counts as a tamer spell for you, but it doesn’t count against the number of tamer spells you know.Swarmslinger Spells\n| Tamer Level | Spell |\n| -- | -- |\n| 3rd | command, shield**|\n| 5th | enlarge/reduce, protection*|\n| 9th | hypnotic pattern**, spirit guardians** |\n| 13th | freedom of movement**, polymorph*** |\n| 17th | insect plague, mislead** |*See Appendix A.\n**These spells are themed around swarms; shield might summon a swarm of bees to deflect the attack, while spirit guardians could manifest as a swarm of flying piranhas.\n***This must be a swarm and isn't limited to beasts.7th-Level Swarmslinger Feature\nAs an action, you magically conjure duplicates of your swarm companion’s individual members. Until the start of your next turn, its size increases by two categories (up to Gargantuan, ignoring the maximum companion size restriction), and it gains temporary hit points equal to its hit point maximum. As an action on its turn, your swarm companion can make three melee weapon attacks divided as it wishes among targets in its space.\nOnce you use this action, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest. Starting at 18th level, you can use this action twice before a rest.10th-Level Swarmslinger Feature\nYour swarms can interfere with those whose spaces they share. When a creature whose space your swarm companion shares makes an attack roll, your companion can use its reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll.14th-Level Swarmslinger Feature\nAs an action, you conjure a swarm of Tiny creatures that flit about you in an opaque, protective cloud. For the next minute, you have a flying speed of 30 feet; you have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage; you have advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws; and you are heavily obscured. The swarm is translucent to you, allowing you to see through it.\nAs a bonus action on each of your turns for the feature’s duration, you can launch a portion of the swarm with lethal intent, forcing a creature you can see within 120 feet of you to make a Dexterity saving throw against your tamer spell save DC. The creature takes 13 (3d8) bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage (your choice when you take the action) on a failure, or half as much damage on a success. Once you use this action, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#class"],"headers":[{"heading":"Tamer

When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier\nSpell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifierSpellcasting Focus\nYou can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells.2nd-level Warlock Feature<br>\nIn your study of occult lore, you have unearthed <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/warlock:eldritch-invocations\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/warlock:eldritch-invocations\" target=\"_self\">Eldritch Invocations</a>, fragments of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability.At 2nd level, you gain two eldritch invocations of your choice.

A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class.Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you could learn at that level.3rd-level Warlock Feature\nAt 3rd level, your otherworldly patron bestows a gift upon you for your loyal service. You gain one of the following features of your choice.\nPact of the Blade <br>You can use your action to create a pact <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/weapons\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/weapons\" target=\"_self\">weapon</a> in your empty hand. You can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you create it. You are proficient with it while you wield it. This weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.\nYour pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die.\nYou can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest.\nYou can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter. You can't affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks. Pact of the Chain <br>You learn the <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:find-familiar\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:find-familiar\" target=\"_self\"><em></em></a>find familiar spell and can cast it as a ritual. The spell doesn't count against your number of spells known.\nWhen you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: imp, pseudodragon, quasit, or sprite.\nAdditionally, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack with its reaction. Pact of the Tome Your patron gives you a grimoire called a Book of Shadows. When you gain this feature, choose three cantrips from any class's spell list (the three needn't be from the same list). While the book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They don't count against your number of cantrips known. If they don't appear on the warlock spell list, they are nonetheless warlock spells for you.\nIf you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book turns to ash when you die. Pact of the Talisman Your patron gives you an amulet, a talisman that can aid the wearer when the need is great. When the wearer fails an ability check, they can add a d4 to the roll, potentially turning the roll into a success. This benefit can be used a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and all expended uses are restored when you finish a long rest.\nIf you lose the talisman, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous amulet. The talisman turns to ash when you die. 4th-level Warlock Feature\nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can do one of the following, representing a change of focus in your occult studies:\nReplace one cantrip you learned from this class's Pact Magic feature with another cantrip from the warlock spell list.\nReplace the option you chose for the Pact Boon feature with one of that feature's other options.\nIf you're 12th level or higher, replace one spell from your Mystic Arcanum feature with another warlock spell of the same level.\nIf this change makes you ineligible for any of your Eldritch Invocations, you must also replace them now, choosing invocations for which you qualify.11th-level Warlock Feature\nAt 11th level, your patron bestows upon you a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one 6th-level spell from the warlock spell list as this arcanum.You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again.At higher levels, you gain more warlock spells of your choice that can be cast in this way: one 7th-level spell at 13th level, one 8th-level spell at 15th level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th level. You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a long rest.20th-level Warlock Feature\nAt 20th level, you can draw on your inner reserve of mystical power while entreating your patron to regain expended spell slots. You can spend 1 minute entreating your patron for aid to regain all your expended spell slots from your Pact Magic feature. Once you regain spell slots with this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.<br><a href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se?query=tag:TheGriffonsSaddlebag_BookOne\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#TheGriffonsSaddlebag_BookOne\">#TheGriffonsSaddlebag_BookOne</a><br>\n<img alt=\"00_attachments/ClassImages/Warlock - The Astral Griffon.webp\" src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/classimages/warlock-the-astral-griffon.webp\" target=\"_self\">Throughout the ever-expanding multiverse, new and powerful forces emerge as quickly as they're vanquished. These great creatures, be they mortals, demigods, or gods themselves, can make as good an ally as they can a terrifying adversary.You may find yourself called to serve one of these new figures as a bound subject, forging a pact to wield some of this great new power. While sheer might is always admirable, the wisdom to choose the right path is always more so.You have made a pact with a powerful demigod of the Astral Plane: a Griffon whose control over space, creation, and pocket dimensions extends throughout the multiverse. It aims to expand its eclectic collection of treasures, both magical and mundane. These treasures may be worth very little in the average shop, but to the Griffon it holds a special place in history or the fabric of existence. Your binding may lead you far and wide in search of foreign artifacts as quickly as it would a nearby pub for a tarnished locket. Regardless of the task, the Griffon's aims are rarely subject to distinctly good or evil motives.The Astral Griffon lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.1st-level Astral Griffon Feature\nAt 1st level, your patron grants you the ability to maintain a small pocket dimension. The extradimensional space is always accessible to you and can hold up to 50 pounds of in- animate material, not exceeding 1 cubic foot. You can access and interact with this space using your hands the same way you would with a normal container. Your hands disappear within the space while they're accessing it.Placing a bag of holding, handy haversack, portable hole, or similar item inside your pocket dimension instantly destroys both the item and anything else within the two extradimensional spaces. When this happens, you are unable to access your pocket dimension again until 7 days have passed.In addition, you can sense whether pocket dimensions are present within 60 feet of you. This feature doesn't reveal their location or number.6th-level Astral Griffon Feature\nBy 6th level, you can hide yourself in a temporary extradimensional space to avoid harm. When you take damage from a hostile creature you can see within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to disappear into a harmless pocket dimension. You can see into your original plane of existence and move normally while in this extradimensional space, but other creatures can neither see nor harm you while you remain there. You remain in this pocket dimension until the end of your next turn or until you attack or cast a spell. Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.10th-level Astral Griffon Feature\nStarting at 10th level, the fabric of existence is clear to you. You have resistance to force damage, and whenever you discover an extradimensional space, you can perceive what items are stored within it.In addition, you can use an action to enhance your perception of reality. For 10 minutes, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight, and you gain truesight out to 30 feet. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.14th-level Astral Griffon Feature\nAt 14th level, you've learned how to mold extradimensional spaces beyond their normal limits. Your pocket dimension expands to hold up to 250 pounds, or 10 cubic feet.In addition, you can use an action to shunt an object that isn't being worn that you can see within 30 feet of you into your pocket dimension, provided that there's enough space. If the object is being carried, the holder must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. The object remains in the extradimensional space until the end of your next turn or until you retrieve it. When the effect ends, the object reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you or in your hands, if you have any free (your choice). Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.<br><a href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se?query=tag:TheGriffonsSaddlebag_BookTwo\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#TheGriffonsSaddlebag_BookTwo\">#TheGriffonsSaddlebag_BookTwo</a><br>\n<img alt=\"Warlock - The Many.webp\" src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/classimages/warlock-the-many.webp\" target=\"_self\">\nNot all who possess magic come by it naturally. A warlock forges a pact with a powerful being in exchange for a portion of its knowledge and strength. Some of these arrangements become cruel forms of indebted servitude, but most are closer to that of an apprentice and its master: the warlock learns and grows in strength in exchange for rendering the occassional service on behalf of their patron. As a warlock, you may find your patron by circumstance or by hard work, but regardless of your circumstance, your need for power will continue to grow and shape you as you benefit from your pact and patron.Your patron is a powerful entity composed of a multitude of heads. These heads provide unique strengths, such as the regenerative properties of a mighty hydra, or the bewitching gaze of a medusa.Your patron may consider you one of its estranged or forgotten heads, allowing you to do as you please, or compel you to work toward a shared goal as one of its own. Those that make a pact with a patron such as this may find beauty in patterns or matching sets, or become plagued with internal bickering and indecisiveness. Regardless, one thing is for certain: two heads are always better than one.Entities of this type include extremely powerful or godlike multi-headed or -conscioused beings, swarms, or hiveminds. Example patrons in this book include the Butcher Dray, Three-Headed Ettin; Grihoo, the Superhydra; Lady Feluciana, Legendary Medusa Sorceress; the Thousand Voices, Supreme Soul Vortex; and Vaanor, Primeval Cerberus. Details on these patrons can be found in appendix I on page 378.The Many lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.1st-level The Many feature\nAt 1st level, you gain a number of eldritch heads equal to your proficiency bonus. Only you and creatures with truesight can see these heads, which sprout from your shoulders as representations of your patron. You can choose to ignore the heads and cause them to vanish from your vision.\nThese eldritch heads provide you with motes of power from your patron that can be expended to grant you the following benefits:\nOnce per turn, you can expend one head when you hit a creature with an attack to cause that creature to take extra psychic damage equal to 1 + your proficiency bonus.\nWhen you make a Charisma (Intimidation) check, you can expend one head to gain advantage on the roll. When you do, your eldritch heads become briefly visible to everyone.\nWhen you fail a death saving throw, you can expend one head to succeed instead.\nWhen a head is expended, its appearance becomes wispy and gaseous, but its glowing eyes remain. You regain all expended heads when you finish a long rest.In addition, you can use a bonus action to beseech your patron to restore two of your expended heads. Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.1st-level The Many feature\nAlso at 1st level, while you have at least one eldritch head remaining, you can’t be surprised, and if a creature would gain advantage on an attack roll against you due to having its ally within 5 feet of you, it makes the attack roll without advantage.6th-level The Many feature\nAt 6th level, you’ve devised more ways to use your eldritch heads. You gain the following benefits:\nYou can use a bonus action to expend one eldritch head, reabsorbing it to gain a number of temporary hit points equal to 2d6 + your Charisma modifier.\nOnce per turn, you can expend one head to take a reaction even if you’ve already used your reaction. You can’t use this benefit on the same turn that you take your normal reaction.\nWhen you fail a saving throw against being charmed, frightened, or put to sleep by magic, you can expend one head to reroll the saving throw. If you do so, you must use the new roll.\n10th-level The Many feature\nStarting at 10th level, your eldritch heads are always there to support your mortal mind and body. You gain a bonus to Intelligence checks, Wisdom (Perception) checks, and Intelligence saving throws equal to half your proficiency bonus.14th-level The Many feature\nStarting at 14th level, you can use an action to revive your expended eldritch heads in a frenzied burst, during which time they become visible to everyone. When you do, you regain all expended heads, which releases a thunderous roar audible out to 300 feet as they tear into existence. Choose a number of creatures within 60 feet of you up to the number of heads you regain in this way. Each target must make an Intelligence saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. On a failed save, a target takes 4d8 psychic damage and is incapacitated until the end of your next turn as its mind is flooded with otherworldly energy. On a successful save, a target takes half as much psychic damage and isn’t incapacitated.Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.<br><a href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se?query=tag:RyokosGuideToTheYokaiRealms\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#RyokosGuideToTheYokaiRealms\">#RyokosGuideToTheYokaiRealms</a><br>\n<img alt=\"Warlock - The Shinigami.webp\" src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/classimages/warlock-the-shinigami.webp\" target=\"_self\">\nYou have entered into a pact with a shinigami, a fearsome spirit of the netherworld, with powers of death and possession. Shinigami themselves are beings of variable character, some playing active roles in the lives of their emissaries, others inscrutable and shrouded in mystery. All, however, serve a singular, ultimate purpose: to perpetuate death. Those who wield a shinigami’s power spin magic of shadow and authority, puppeteering objects, creatures, servants, and thralls. Such magic is as vicious and precise as it is hated and feared; even those with noble intent who enter into a shinigami’s pact become equal in terror to the evil they seek to vanquish.1st-Level Shinigami Feature\nThe Shinigami lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.1st-Level Shinigami Feature\nAs a bonus action, you can take control of a corpse or unconscious creature you can see within 60 feet of you for 10 minutes or until you lose concentration (as if concentrating on a spell). The target must be Large or smaller and of a CR equal to or less than your warlock level (or the CR it had in life if it’s a corpse). The size of target you can control with this feature increases to Huge at 6th level and Gargantuan at 14th level.\nWhile you control a target in this way, it uses its own stat block with the following changes:\nIt’s treated as an Undead creature if it’s a corpse.\nIt can’t gain hit points or recover from the unconscious condition.\nIt’s immune to the charmed and frightened conditions.\nIt gains temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier plus five times your warlock level.\nIt can use your spellcasting ability modifier for its attack and damage rolls.\nWhen its temporary hit points are depleted, your control of the target ends, and you can’t use this feature on that target again until you finish a long rest. If the target was unconscious, and it has more than 0 hit points, it immediately regains consciousness when your control over it ends.\nYour puppet takes its turn immediately after yours. It does nothing unless you use a bonus action on your turn to command it to take an action. That action can be one in its stat block (or in the stat block it had in life if it’s a corpse) or some other action.\nLimited Control. There are limitations to the scope of your influence over your puppet. While you are puppeting a target, it can’t cast spells and can’t use any reactions, any legendary actions, any lair actions, and any actions that create or summon additional creatures (such as a wraith’s Create Specter action).\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. If you have no uses left, you can use it if you expend a spell slot from your Pact Magic when you take the action to activate it.\n1st-Level Shinigami Feature\nYour bond to the shinigami grants you a piercing insight into the lifespan of others and reveals the best way to cut it short. As a bonus action, you can focus your attention on one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. You become aware of one of its damage vulnerabilities (if any) and one its damage resistances or damage immunities (if any).6th-Level Shinigami Feature\nWhile you are puppeteering a target using your Grim Puppeteer feature, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you also target your puppet.10th-Level Shinigami Feature\nYou have developed the power of precise and meticulous control over your puppets. While a target is under the effect of your Grim Puppeteer feature, you can see through its eyes, hear what it hears, and speak through it using its own voice. You can now puppeteer a creature for up to 1 hour or until you lose your concentration.\nA creature interacting with the puppet can use an action to make a Wisdom (Insight) check against your warlock spell save DC, identifying something awry on a success.\nAdditionally, creatures you puppeteer have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks that aren’t silvered.14th-Level Shinigami Feature\nWhen you are reduced to 0 hit points, you don’t fall unconscious. Instead, your spirit is thrown from your physical form, and you are able to continue to fight, puppeteering your own body as a disembodied spirit of death.\nWhile puppeteering your own body in this way, your game statistics and capabilities remain the same, you can’t puppeteer another creature, you don’t make death saving throws, taking damage doesn’t result in a failed death save, and you gain temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier plus five times your warlock level. Your spirit returns to your body immediately if you regain at least 1 hit point.\nYou can’t fall unconscious until your temporary hit points are depleted, at which time your spirit returns to your body and this feature ends.\nOnce you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.<br><a href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se?query=tag:HelianasGuideToMonsterHunting\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#HelianasGuideToMonsterHunting\">#HelianasGuideToMonsterHunting</a><br>\n<img alt=\"Warlock - The Parasite.webp\" src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/classimages/warlock-the-parasite.webp\" target=\"_self\">\nYou have bonded, mind and body, with a rare and enigmatic being that calls your body home, whether you like it or not. Its origins are unknown; perhaps it came from a vat of biomantic mut-x, the nightmares of an astral projector, or a subterranean pool of primordial ooze. Survival is its watchword and you are its host.1st-level Parasite feature\nThe Parasite lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.Some of the spells in the Parasite Expanded Spells table have a divine flavour to them. Feel free to corrupt these to fit your parasitic patron! For example, sanctuary might be represented as part of your parasitic symbiont warding the target of your spell from damaging blows. Spirit guardians probably deals necrotic damage, even if you’re not evil, and could manifest as viscous threads of corrupting ichor that whirl around you with a mind of their own. If you’re especially into horror, you could even express dominate person as a part of your patron physically invading your target’s cranium through a nostril!1st-level Parasite feature\nYour patron can manifest on and protrude from your body in the form of a parasitic weapon—claws, teeth, tendrils, or other appendages. As a bonus action, you can manifest this parasitic weapon; you gain a new attack option that you can use when you take the Attack action on your turn. This special attack is a melee spell attack, with a reach equal to five times your proficiency bonus. The attack deals 1d12 bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage on a hit (your choice when you manifest the weapon). You don’t add your ability modifier to the damage of the parasitic weapon.\nThe parasitic weapon retracts back into your body if you are incapacitated or you use a bonus action to end it.The number of attacks you can make with your parasitic weapons when you take the Attack action on your turn increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to two attacks at 5th level, three attacks at 11th level, and four attacks at 17th level. If you have another feature that allows you to make multiple attacks as part of the Attack action (such as Extra Attack), making any of those extra attacks each replace one of these parasitic weapon attacks.Starting at 6th level, your attacks with your parasitic weapon count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.This parasitic weapon can’t be used for opportunity attacks; it specifies that it is only usable when you take the Attack action. Opportunity attacks are made using reactions. Opportunity attacks with a 30-foot-reach weapon would be hard to keep track of!1st-level Parasite feature\nInvested in your survival, your patron manifests in protective ways. You can use your Charisma modifier in place of your Strength modifier when making Strength saving throws. In addition, as a bonus action, you can cause your patron to manifest in your free hand as a shield, with which you are proficient. This shield disappears if you are incapacitated or if you dismiss it as a bonus action. When you reach 10th level in this class, this shield increases your AC by 3 instead of 2.6th-level Parasite feature\nAs a bonus action, you can transform your body into a viscous, liquid form for 10 minutes. You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space or merges into your new form. For the duration, you can squeeze through a space as narrow as 6 inches wide, and moving through difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. After you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.6th-level Parasite feature\nOver the course of 1 minute, you can extrude an independent piece of your patron, causing it to manifest in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. This parasite acts as a familiar, as if with the find familiar spell. See this creature’s game statistics in the parasitic ooze stat block (page 215), which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places. If you have the Pact of the Chain feature, the parasite counts as a familiar for you for the purpose of applying any benefits from that feature or your invocations.\nAfter you birth a parasite, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest. If you use this feature while you already have a parasite, the previous one dissolves in a puddle of goo.10th-level Parasite feature\nAt 10th level, you learn new ways to use your parasitic ooze to aid your friends or harm your foes. As a bonus action while your parasitic ooze isn’t incapacitated, you can command it to immediately use one of the options below.The ooze moves up to its speed and then explodes, causing it to drop to 0 hit points. Each creature within 10 feet of the ooze must make a Dexterity saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d6 necrotic damage and is blinded until the end of your next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t blinded.The ooze moves up to its speed and attaches to the body of a willing creature within 5 feet of it. While attached in this way, the ooze is incapacitated, has a speed of 0 feet, and you can communicate telepathically with the creature it’s attached to, whether or not you share a common language. Whenever the creature the ooze is attached to takes damage, the ooze takes the damage instead. As a bonus action, you can command the ooze to detach from the creature.<br>\n<img alt=\"Warlock - Parasite - Statblock.webp\" src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/classimages/warlock-parasite-statblock.webp\" target=\"_self\">14th-level Parasite feature\nYour patron allows you to unleash a modicum of its true power as it envelops your form. As an action, you can gain the following benefits for 1 minute:\nYou grow in size by one category—from Medium to Large, for example. If you lack the room to grow, your size doesn’t change.\nYou gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1) at the start of each of your turns.\nThe damage dice of your parasitic weapon increases to 2d8.\nYour parasitic weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.\nWhenever you take damage from a creature within your parasitic weapon’s reach, you can use your reaction to make an attack with the parasitic weapon against that creature.\nOnce you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.\nEldritch Invocation (Prerequisite: Parasite patron):\nWhen you score a critical hit with your parasitic weapon or reduce a creature to 0 hit points with it, you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to the number rolled on the weapon’s damage dice. If you later gain the Pact of the Blade feature, you gain this benefit to critical hits scored with your pact weapon.If you are the GM, consider allowing invocations that have the eldritch blast cantrip as a prerequisite to also benefit attacks the warlock makes with their parasitic weapon. For example, Repelling Blast would permit the parasitic weapon to push targets, while Agonizing Blast would allow the warlock to add their Charisma modifier to its damage rolls. However, take this with a pinch of salt; Eldritch Spear extends the weapon’s reach by a factor of 2.5 only, not 180 feet!","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#class"],"headers":[{"heading":"Warlock Features","level":1,"id":"Warlock_Features_0"},{"heading":"Hit Points","level":2,"id":"Hit_Points_0"},{"heading":"Proficiencies","level":2,"id":"Proficiencies_0"},{"heading":"Equipment","level":2,"id":"Equipment_0"},{"heading":"Otherworldly Patron","level":2,"id":"Otherworldly_Patron_0"},{"heading":"Pact Magic","level":2,"id":"Pact_Magic_0"},{"heading":"Cantrips","level":3,"id":"Cantrips_0"},{"heading":"Spell Slots","level":3,"id":"Spell_Slots_0"},{"heading":"Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher","level":3,"id":"Spells_Known_of_1st_Level_and_Higher_0"},{"heading":"Spellcasting Ability","level":3,"id":"Spellcasting_Ability_0"},{"heading":"Eldritch Invocations","level":2,"id":"Eldritch_Invocations_0"},{"heading":"Pact Boon","level":2,"id":"Pact_Boon_0"},{"heading":"Ability Score Improvement","level":2,"id":"Ability_Score_Improvement_0"},{"heading":"Eldritch Versatility (Optional)","level":2,"id":"Eldritch_Versatility_(Optional)_0"},{"heading":"Mystic Arcanum","level":2,"id":"Mystic_Arcanum_0"},{"heading":"Eldritch Master","level":2,"id":"Eldritch_Master_0"},{"heading":"Subclasses","level":1,"id":"Subclasses_0"},{"heading":"The Astral Griffon","level":2,"id":"The_Astral_Griffon_0"},{"heading":"Expanded Spell List","level":3,"id":"Expanded_Spell_List_0"},{"heading":"Astral Griffon Expanded Spells","level":3,"id":"Astral_Griffon_Expanded_Spells_0"},{"heading":"Extradimensional Acuity","level":3,"id":"Extradimensional_Acuity_0"},{"heading":"Planar Escape","level":3,"id":"Planar_Escape_0"},{"heading":"Extradimensional Mastery","level":3,"id":"Extradimensional_Mastery_0"},{"heading":"Pocketeer","level":3,"id":"Pocketeer_0"},{"heading":"The Many","level":2,"id":"The_Many_0"},{"heading":"EXPANDED SPELL LIST","level":3,"id":"EXPANDED_SPELL_LIST_0"},{"heading":"ELDRITCH HEADS","level":3,"id":"ELDRITCH_HEADS_0"},{"heading":"GUARDED","level":3,"id":"GUARDED_0"},{"heading":"IMPROVED ELDRITCH HEADS","level":3,"id":"IMPROVED_ELDRITCH_HEADS_0"},{"heading":"GROUPTHINK","level":3,"id":"GROUPTHINK_0"},{"heading":"ELDRITCH FRENZY","level":3,"id":"ELDRITCH_FRENZY_0"},{"heading":"The Shinigami","level":2,"id":"The_Shinigami_0"},{"heading":"Expanded Spell List","level":3,"id":"Expanded_Spell_List_1"},{"heading":"Grim Puppeteer","level":3,"id":"Grim_Puppeteer_0"},{"heading":"Shinigami Vision","level":3,"id":"Shinigami_Vision_0"},{"heading":"Gift of the Psychopomp","level":3,"id":"Gift_of_the_Psychopomp_0"},{"heading":"Shinigami Domination","level":3,"id":"Shinigami_Domination_0"},{"heading":"Master of Death","level":3,"id":"Master_of_Death_0"},{"heading":"The Parasite","level":2,"id":"The_Parasite_0"},{"heading":"Expanded Spell List","level":3,"id":"Expanded_Spell_List_2"},{"heading":"Flavouring Spells","level":3,"id":"Flavouring_Spells_0"},{"heading":"Parasitic Weapon","level":3,"id":"Parasitic_Weapon_0"},{"heading":"Parasitic Flurry","level":4,"id":"Parasitic_Flurry_0"},{"heading":"Magical Weapons","level":4,"id":"Magical_Weapons_0"},{"heading":"Opportunity Attacks &amp;

New cultures present new ways of thinking, and new ideas make room for new questions and answers. What kind of wizard are you? Do you explore the new and unknown, or do you find value in advancing already established ways of thinking?Will you be a leading mind on the forefront of the inexplicable? Or will you continue to hunt for answers to the questions that no one has thought to ask?Some wizards abandon the limitations set by magic schools and instead focus on the binding force that holds everything together. These mages spend their efforts weaving and recreating matter from thin air to create art as well as utility. They value the craftsmanship taught by artisans around the world and consider their skills and creations to be a form of magic all its own.Some arcanists focus on altering the living, whereas wizards of material magic focus on creating and enhancing the inanimate. These mages see beauty in the possibility presented by raw materials, and are found as readily studying ancient lore as they are in the center of a bustling forge. Many followers of this tradition take great care and pride in their component pouches, and find great kinship among bards, artists, and other craftsmen.2nd-level Material Magic Feature\nBeginning at 2nd level, you have dedicated your studies to creation and the magic surrounding it. You gain proficiency with three artisan’s tools of your choice and you learn the mending cantrip. If you already know this cantrip, you learn a different wizard cantrip of your choice. The cantrip doesn’t count against your number of cantrips known.In addition, your exceptional wit and aptitude allow you to do more with less time. When you use a set of artisan’s tools with which you are proficient to craft an item or piece of art, you complete a full work day in a number of hours equal to 8 – your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1).2nd-level Material Magic Feature\nAlso at 2nd level, you can temporarily bend some of the laws of reality in your favor. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher, you can create a cube of material measuring up to 5 feet large on a side on the ground in an unoccupied space you can see within 10 feet of you. You choose the material it’s made out of. A cube weighs a number of pounds equal to 5 times its size on a side, regardless of its material, and can support up to 10 times its weight.You can have a total number of these cubes in existence at any time equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1). You can dismiss any number of these cubes as a bonus action. Otherwise, a cube disappears after 1 hour or if it takes any damage.6th-level Material Magic Feature\nAt 6th level, your attention to both magic and mundane detail gives you a heightened understanding and control over them. As an action, you can touch an object, weapon, or piece of armor. Until the end of your next short or long rest, the item becomes magical if it isn’t already, and gains your choice of up to two of the following benefits:\nIt emits bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.\nIts weight is halved.\nWhen you throw it, immediately after it hits a creature or a solid object, it flies back to your hand. y You change any of its colors, smells, and textures.\n(Weapon only) The wielder of it gains a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon. If the weapon already granted a bonus to attack and damage rolls, this property has no effect.\n(Armor only) The wearer gains a +1 bonus to AC. If the armor already granted a bonus to AC, this property has no effect.\n(Armor only) If the armor would normally impose disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks, it does not.\nYou have 2 uses of this feature, and you expend 1 of its uses for each benefit you give an object. You regain all expended uses of this feature when you finish a short or long rest.10th-level Material Magic Feature\nStarting at 10th level, your spells deal double damage to objects and structures, and when you deal damage to a construct with an attack or a spell, it takes an extra 1d8 force damage. 14th-level Material Magic Feature\nAt 14th level, when you destroy a Large or smaller nonmagical object or structure with a spell, you can recreate it as an action once within the next 8 hours. When you do, the object or structure reappears intact in an unoccupied space you choose within 60 feet of you. If the object or structure is recreated in the air, it immediately falls. Any creature below the item must make a Dexterity saving throw against your wizard spell save DC. If the object is Small or smaller, a creature that fails the saving throw takes 1d8 bludgeoning damage from the impact for every 10 feet that it fell. If the object is Medium or Large, the bludgeoning damage increases to 1d10 or 1d12 for every 10 feet it fell, respectively. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much bludgeoning damage. If an object is the same size or larger than a creature it falls on, that creature is pushed to the nearest unoccupied space.Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.<br><a href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se?query=tag:TheGriffonsSaddlebag_BookTwo\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#TheGriffonsSaddlebag_BookTwo\">#TheGriffonsSaddlebag_BookTwo</a><br>\n<img alt=\"Wizard - Wand Lore.webp\" src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/classimages/wizard-wand-lore.webp\" target=\"_self\">\nWizards are often considered to be founts of knowledge, a reputation rightfully earned after generations and lives spent poring over forgotten texts and ancient manuscripts. These knowledge-seeking mages ultimately pursue the school of magic that interests them the most, becoming true masters of their craft and labor. Some find satisfaction in studying mystical arts, while others focus their efforts on more practical or even explosive forms of magic. As a result, wizards around the world can be found on the councils of nobles as quickly they can in the service of carnivals.Some children grow up sword-fighting with sticks and become soldiers, but you’ve learned how to turn a simple stick into something more powerful than a blade. The study of wand lore delves deeper into old magic, beyond the normal lists of components and incantations, and into the rich history and tradition of wandcraft. As a wizard of wand lore, you know that a mage’s true power can be amplified with the right tool: for you, that tool is a wand of your own creation1st-level Wand Lore feature\nWhen you choose this tradition at 2nd level, you create a special wand called a core wand, which you can use as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells. You determine the wand’s appearance, and only you are capable of us- ing it. You can use a bonus action to summon the wand to your hand, regardless of physical or planar distances. If this wand is destroyed, you can create a new one over the course of 8 hours of work.\nYour core wand gains power each time you use it to cast a spell. This power is represented by core charges. The wand can have up to 7 core charges at a time, and whenever you finish a long rest, the number of core charges in the wand resets to 1. Whenever you expend a spell slot to cast a spell of 1st level or higher while holding your wand, it gains up to a number of core charges equal to half the spell’s level (minimum of 1). You can expend these core charges in the following ways:\nWhenever you make an attack roll or saving throw, you can expend any number of core charges to gain a bonus to the roll equal to the number of core charges spent. You can wait until after you roll the d20, but must decide before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails.\nWhenever you are hit by an attack, you can expend any number of core charges from your wand as a reaction to gain a bonus to AC against that attack equal to the number of core charges spent.\n2nd-level Wand Lore feature\nStarting at 2nd level, you can interpret staves and wands the way other wizards read scrolls and spellbooks. If a staff or wand in your possession can cast a spell that’s on the wizard spell list, you can copy the spell into your spellbook as if you were copying a spell from a scroll.In addition, when you cast a wizard spell with a range of touch while holding your core wand, you can choose a target that you can see and isn’t behind cover up to 10 feet away from you instead. At 14th level, this range increases to 30 feet.6th-level Wand Lore feature\nBeginning at 6th level, when you use your Arcane Recovery feature, your core wand regains 3 expended core charges.In addition, you gain a new option to use your wand’s core charges. When you cast a spell that targets only one creature and forces it to make a saving throw while you’re holding your core wand, you can expend up to 3 core charges to gain a bonus to that spell’s save DC equal to the number of core charges spent10th-level Wand Lore feature\nStarting at 10th level, whenever you finish a long rest, you can imbue a number of wizard spells from your spellbook up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one) into a nonmagical stick, dowel, or similar Tiny object, transforming the object into a magic wand. Each spell must be a cantrip or a 1st- or 2nd-level spell and have a casting time of 1 action or bonus action. In addition, the spells can’t require concentration or require any material components that indicate a cost or are consumed as part of casting the spell, and if the spell is a cantrip, it mustn’t be able to damage a target.The wand has a number of charges equal to your Intel- ligence modifier (minimum of 1) with which to cast the imbued cantrips (0 charges), 1st-level spells (1 charge), or 2nd-level spells (2 charges). A creature holding the wand can use an action to cast one of the spells from it using your spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability. The wand ceases to be magical the next time you finish a long rest.14th-level Wand Lore feature\nWhen you reach 14th level, you can convert the core charges within your wand into raw, arcane energy. By manipulating this energy, you can use the wand’s core charges in the following new ways:\nAs a bonus action, you can expend 1 or more of the wand’s core charges to create a number of motes of magical force equal to the core charges spent. Each mote streaks toward a different target that you can see within 60 feet of you, dealing force damage to each target equal to 1d4 + your Intelligence modifier.\nWhen you or another creature that you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to expend 1 or more of the wand’s core charges to create a magical barrier, reducing the damage taken by an amount equal to three times the number of core charges spent.\nIn addition, you have gained a supreme mastery and understanding of wands. If you expend the last charge of a staff or wand, you needn’t roll a d20, even if it says to. Further, the gold and time you must spend to craft a magic wand is halved\n<br><a href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se?query=tag:RyokosGuideToTheYokaiRealms\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#RyokosGuideToTheYokaiRealms\">#RyokosGuideToTheYokaiRealms</a><br>\n<img alt=\"Wizard - Shinobi.webp\" src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/classimages/wizard-shinobi.webp\" target=\"_self\">\nMasters of illusion, guerilla warfare, and martial combat, Shinobi wizards are elusive tricksters and deadly warriors, striking in a furious onslaught of magic, weaponry, and acrobatics. They adopt a philosophy which unifies martial skill with spellcasting, empowering their blows with devastating magical enhancements before vanishing into darkness. A Shinobi’s unique abilities make them the ultimate artisans of espionage and infiltration, wielding deception, secrecy, and explosive aggression as lethal tools in their arsenal.2nd-Level Shinobi Feature\nYou gain proficiency with light armour, hand crossbows, Thrown weapons, and Finesse weapons; you gain proficiency with the Stealth skill; and you can use a weapon you are proficient with as your spellcasting focus. Finally, you gain darkvision out to 60 feet, or if you already have darkvision, its range is increased by 30 feet.2nd-Level Shinobi Feature\nYou have learned the art of synchronising spellcasting and weaponry. Immediately after you hit a creature with a weapon attack on your turn, you can use a bonus action and expend one spell slot to deal extra damage to that target, equal to 1d8 damage per level of the spell slot expended. You can then perform one of the following techniques as a part of that bonus action:\nCloud of Shadow. You create a small cloud of magical darkness, heavily obscuring the space you are currently occupying. This darkness lasts for 1 minute, and it ends early if you are knocked unconscious. A creature with darkvision can’t see through this darkness, and nonmagical light can’t illuminate it.\nEnervating Touch. The sting of your blow magically saps the target’s strength. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your wizard spell save DC or take an extra 1d8 poison damage and be poisoned until the end of your next turn.\nShadow Vanishing. You spend 10 feet of movement to teleport to an area of dim light or darkness you can see within 30 feet of you.\nShadow Ward. Choose one damage type other than force or radiant. You gain resistance to that damage type until the start of your next turn.6th-Level Shinobi Feature\nYou can attack twice rather than once when you take the Attack action on your turn. In addition, magical darkness doesn’t impede your vision.10th-Level Shinobi Feature\nYour command of shadow magic further enhances your lethal capabilities. You can now also choose from the following options when you use your Shadow Striker feature, but only if you empower your attack with a spell slot of 3rd level or higher.\nDuplicitous Strike. You move in a blur, sprouting magical images in the mind of your target. The target takes an extra 1d8 psychic damage, and it sees illusory duplicates of you until the end of its next turn. Whenever it targets you with an attack, it must roll a d4. On a 1-3, it targets a duplicate instead and the attack misses.\nRapid Strikes. You magically strike with blistering speed. Make a weapon attack against a target within range. On a hit, that attack deals an extra 2d8 force damage.\nVanish. A shimmering veil of abjuration magic bursts into existence around you. You gain 2d8 temporary hit points. In addition, you turn invisible until the end of your next turn. While invisible in this way, spells you cast don’t require any verbal or somatic components.14th-Level Shinobi Feature\nThe shadows are your eager servants. When another creature you can see moves into an area that is heavily obscured from an effect you have magically created or starts its turn there, you can force it to make a Strength saving throw against your wizard spell save DC (no action required). On a failure, the creature is restrained until the start of its next turn. A creature can be forced to make this saving throw no more than once per turn.<br><a href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se?query=tag:HelianasGuideToMonsterHunting\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#HelianasGuideToMonsterHunting\">#HelianasGuideToMonsterHunting</a><br>\n<img alt=\"Wizard - School of Biomancy.webp\" src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/classimages/wizard-school-of-biomancy.webp\" target=\"_self\">\nPractitioners of biomancy tend to have a growth mindset and an endless propensity for self-improvement. You likely bear symptoms of this continual desire to improve yourself: patches of scales, manes of peacock feathers, hawk’s eyes, adhesive palms, gills… the list is as long as there are ideas to try. Biomancers are masters of biomantically-enhanced surgery, transplanting specially-grown (or amputated) appendages onto other creatures.2nd-level School of Biomancy feature\nBeginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy a biomancy spell into your spellbook is halved. In addition, you gain proficiency with surgeon’s tools, and the following spells are considered biomancy spells for you instead of their normal school.<br>*See page 494 - 495 for lists of spells that can be from the school of biomancy. Or <a data-href=\"94_Character_Creation/Spells/Spells\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/94_character_creation/spells/spells.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">94_Character_Creation/Spells/Spells</a>2nd-level School of Biomancy feature\nYou learn to channel biomantic magic into your cells, restoring your vitality. When you use a spell slot to cast a biomancy spell of 1st level or higher, you can simultaneously redirect a strand of the spell’s magic to energise and repair you or your target’s body. You or your target (your choice) regains a number of hit points equal to twice the spell’s level.6th-level School of Biomancy feature\nYou can perform minor surgery on your body, improving yourself in a very literal sense. Over the course of 1 hour (which can be done during a rest), you can enhance yourself with one bio-magical improvement, choosing from the following options:\nAmphibisprings. With enhanced quads and a ratcheting mechanism in your achilles, your jumping distance is tripled.\nExtra Appendage. You gain a prehensile tail or an extra arm, allowing you to hold one more thing and conferring advantage on any ability checks you make to climb.\nDetachable Hand. As an action, you can detach your hand and imbue it with biomantic magic. The hand follows the rules of the unseen servant spell, except it is not invisible and waits patiently if ever more than 60 feet away from you. If your hand is ever reduced to 0 hit points, it is destroyed, and you grow a new one over the course of a short or long rest.\nFirefly Skin. You can cast the light cantrip at will with yourself as the target. As a bonus action, you can flash brightly for a moment; each creature within 5 feet of you that can see you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your wizard spell save DC or be blinded until the end of your next turn. After you use this bonus action, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.\nOwl Eyes. You gain darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.\nSlime. You exude slime; checks made to grapple you have disadvantage.\nScales. Your skin is covered in overlapping scales. You gain a +1 bonus to AC when you aren’t wearing armour.\nSpidersense. You gain a 1d4 bonus to your initiative rolls.\nTalon. One of your hands is replaced with a wicked giant hawk’s talon, a natural weapon that you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with it, you deal slashing damage equal to 1d8 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. If you are grappling a creature with this talon, you can automatically deal this damage to the grappled creature once on each of your turns as a bonus action.\nThird Leg. Your speed increases by 10 feet and you have advantage on ability checks and saving throws made against effects that would knock you prone.\nTrimorphism. You can cast the enlarge/reduce spell on yourself at will (no material components or concentration required).\nYour body has enough latent biomantic magic to sustain one improvement at a time. When you reach 10th and 14th level, you can sustain up to two and three improvements at a time, respectively. If you gain a new improvement while you have your maximum number of sustainable improvements active, you must choose one improvement to lose; this improvement withers away and ceases to function the moment you finish the surgery on your new improvement.10th-level School of Biomancy feature\nYour fiddling self-improvement has led to the ability to benefit from the magic you create. When you cast a wizard spell that targets only one creature and doesn’t have a range of self, you can choose to simultaneously target yourself with the same spell. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum once), regaining all expended uses when you finish a long rest.14th-level School of Biomancy feature\nOver the course of 1 hour (which can be done during a rest), you can craft a capsule of potent stimulants, choosing from either the Brutish or Swift archetypes, and embed it within your adrenal gland. With a slight tensing of your brain muscles, you can crack this capsule as a bonus action, stimulating your body. For the next minute, you gain the following benefits based on the archetype you chose:\nIf you are smaller than Large, you become Large, and your weight increases proportionately. If you lack the room to become Large, your size doesn’t change.\nYour Strength score increases to match your Intelligence score if it isn’t already higher.\nYou have advantage on Strength and Constitution checks and Strength and Constitution saving throws.\nYou grow an appendage with which you can make melee weapon attacks. When you grow the weapon, you decide whether it deals bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage. You are proficient with this weapon and use your Strength modifier for attack and damage rolls. The weapon deals 2d10 damage.\nYou can attack twice, instead of once, when you take the Attack action on your turn. You ignore this benefit if you already have a feature, like Extra Attack, that lets you attack more than once when you take the Attack action on your turn.\nYou gain temporary hit points equal to twice your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 2) at the start of each of your turns.

It opens up new pathways for players to explore creativity, flavour, and gameplay options, while also reducing some of the power imbalance between martial and spellcasting classes that can emerge at higher levels.Ryoko’s Guide separates classes into three tiers: full-martial, half-martial, and non-martial.•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Full-martial classes: barbarians, fighters, monks, and rogues•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Half-martial classes: benders, paladins, and rangers•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Non-martial classes: bards, clerics, druids, sorcerers, tamers, warlocks, and wizardsIf you have a subclass feature or eldritch invocation that gives you the ability to attack more than once when you take the Attack action (such as the Extra Attack feature), you are considered a half-martial character for the purposes of advanced weapon mastery, even if you belong to a non-martial class. You become a half-martial class in this way when you select the subclass or invocation that grants this feature. For example, a bard who chooses the College of Swords subclass becomes a half-martial when it chooses this subclass at level 3, not when it gains the Extra Attack feature at level 6.Martial Level &amp; Multiclassing. Your martial level dictates the levels at which you unlock advanced weapon mastery advanced techniques. You determine your martial level by adding together all your levels in the full-martial classes and half your levels in half-martial classes (rounded down). For example, a character that has multiclassed as a fighter 3/ranger 7 has a martial level of 6.Advanced Techniques. Advanced techniques are special manoeuvres associated with a weapon property. A character can perform a technique with any weapon that possesses that property, provided the character is proficient with that weapon, has learned the technique, and meets its prerequisites. For example, a character that chooses the Dizzying Strike advanced technique from the Impact technique tree can perform the Dizzying Strike with any weapon that has the Impact property with which they are proficient.Saving Throws. Whenever you use an advanced technique that forces a target to make a saving throw, it is against your martial save DC, which is calculated using any modifiers to your attack rolls with the weapon you are using to perform the technique. This includes your proficiency bonus, your ability modifier (typically Strength or Dexterity, but effects like the shillelagh cantrip could change this), attack roll bonuses if the weapon is magical, or other effects currently affecting you or the weapon. It does not include any bonuses that rely on die rolls, such as the effect of the bless spell or Bardic Inspiration.Martial save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your ability modifier + other attack roll bonusesCritical Hit Threshold. Some of the advanced techniques in this chapter reduce the critical hit threshold of an attack. Usually, a critical hit is scored on a roll of a 20 on the d20.When a technique (such as the Heavy tree’s Executioner) says “your critical hit threshold… is reduced by 1”, this means you score a critical hit on a 19 or 20. These effects stack with other advanced techniques, class features, and combo attacks. For example, a character that takes the Steady Loader and Dead-Eye advanced techniques from the Loading tree scores a critical hit on a roll of 17-20 when they make an attack roll with a Loading weapon. A Champion fighter gets the Improved Critical class feature at 3rd level, letting them score a critical hit on a 19 or 20. If they also take the Executioner advanced technique from the Heavy tree, they score a critical hit on a roll of 18-20 when they make an attack with a Heavy weapon against a prone creature.The new weapons introduced in Ryoko’s Guide bring a plethora of new weapon properties, which are fully described on page 74. Three of these new properties, Impact, Pugilist, and Scourge, have their own advanced weapon mastery technique trees. In order to ensure that every weapon has at least one property with an advanced weapon mastery technique tree, these new properties have also been added to several existing weapons. Three weapons have also had their weapon properties altered to better reflect their attributes: the whip and tetherhook* are now Scourge weapons, not Reach weapons, and the war pick now has the Versatile (1d10) property.*Available in Heliana’s Guide and L’Arsene’s Ledger.Unarmed strikes are a unique case. Despite not being a weapon, unarmed strikes benefit from the Pugilist technique tree as if they had the Pugilist property.1 Included for players using L’Arsene’s Ledger of Treasures and Trinkets.\n2 See page 76 - 77 for more details.\n3 Despite not being a weapon, unarmed strikes benefit from the Pugilist technique tree as if they had the Pugilist property.\n4 Although this item does not have the Scourge property, it counts as a Scourge weapon for the purposes of advanced weapon mastery (see page 76).\n5 While not technically a weapon, shields have their own advanced weapon mastery technique tree.\n6 The advanced techniques in this advanced weapon mastery only benefit melee weaponsWhen you reach martial level 2, you learn one tier 1 advanced technique. As you increase in martial level, you learn more techniques, including more powerful ones at higher tiers, as shown in the Advanced Weapon Mastery Progression table.Technique Trees. Advanced techniques are split into twelve technique trees, each of which is associated with one property: Ammunition, Finesse, Heavy, Impact, Light, Loading, Pugilist, Reach, Scourge*, Shield**, Thrown, and Versatile. Each technique tree has four tiers; to pick an advanced technique from tier 2 or higher, you must know at least one advanced technique from a lower tier in that property’s technique tree. For example, to pick the tier 4 Finesse advanced technique Opportunist, you must have already chosen one of the tier 3 techniques, either Jink or Weak Spot.In addition, advanced techniques have martial level prerequisites as shown on each technique tree and in the Advanced Weapon Mastery Progression table.Optional Rule: Level Up. When you gain a level, you can replace one of the advanced techniques you know with another of your choice for which you meet the prerequisites. You can only do so if this doesn’t remove the prerequisite for another technique you know.*These new properties are explained on page 74. **Shield is not a weapon property, but gets its own technique tree, regardless.Gurf is a 2nd-level barbarian and is therefore a martial level 2 player character. Gurf chose to learn the Fortified Position advanced technique from the Reach technique tree, reflecting the time spent decapitating foes with his favoured weapon: the glaive.Gurf gains two more levels in the barbarian class, meaning he is now a martial level 4 character, allowing him to choose another advanced technique. This time, he chooses a technique from the Heavy technique tree: Executioner. Because Gurf’s glaive has both the Reach and Heavy properties, both advanced techniques enhance his combat prowess when fighting with that weapon.Gurf then decides to multiclass into the ranger class. Ranger is a half-martial class so, for every two ranger levels, Gurf gains one martial level. At character level 8 (barbarian 4/ranger 4), Gurf is a martial level 6 character and can learn another technique. Gurf opts to progress further along the Heavy technique tree, learning the tier 2 advanced technique Superior Strike: Heavy.Every weapon can perform a devastating attack called a superior strike. The tier 2 advanced Superior Strike technique of each technique tree gives you access to the superior strike for all weapons with that property. For example, upon taking the advanced technique Superior Strike: Heavy from the Heavy technique tree at martial level 6, a character can perform a superior strike with any Heavy weapon, such as a greatsword, pike, or glaive.Each weapon has a certain superior strike tied to it. For example, a glaive has the Whirling Strike superior strike, whereas the greatsword has Shockwave. Because both of these weapons have the Heavy property, a character with the Superior Strike: Heavy technique can perform either superior strike if they are holding the requisite weapon. The Weapon Metadata table shows every weapon in the core rules, Ryoko’s Guide, L’Arsene’s Ledger, and Heliana’s Guide, along with their properties and superior strike effects.Shields are a unique case. Technically, they are classified as armour, but as any shield-bearing warrior will tell you, they can be as much a weapon as any sword or axe. Accordingly, shields have a dedicated technique tree and their own superior strike: Shield Slam.When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can choose to make one superior strike in place of one of your regular attacks. You can perform superior strikes in this way a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, but no more than once per turn, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. Like other advanced techniques, when your superior strike forces a creature to make a saving throw, it is against your martial save DC (see page 83).Each weapon type has a specific superior strike it can be used to perform. This is listed in the Weapon Metadata table on page 86. The full list of superior strikes and their effects are as follows:Battery Strike. With incredible Dexterity and speed, you hurl numerous weapons at once. Make a number of ranged weapon attacks equal to 1 plus half your proficiency bonus (rounded down) against targets within the normal range of your weapon. Each attack must be against a different object or creature. You must have available weapons that have this superior strike option on your person with which to make these attacks.Flurry. In a blistering display of speed, you make a number of unarmed strikes equal to 1 plus half your proficiency bonus (rounded down) against creatures within your reach. Each unarmed strike must be against a different target. You then gain a +2 bonus to AC until the start of your next turn.Hail of Ammunition. You let loose a devastating volley of ammunition at a point you choose within your weapon’s normal range. Each creature within a 10-foot-radius sphere centred on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking piercing damage equalling a number of d6s equal to your proficiency bonus on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. You must have at least 10 pieces of ammunition you can draw for the weapon that you use to make this superior strike.Hamstring. In a vicious attack, you attempt to debilitate an enemy. Make an attack roll against a creature within your reach. On a hit, the target suffers the attack’s normal effects and takes extra damage equal to your proficiency bonus. In addition, until the end of its next turn, the creature’s AC is reduced by a value equal to its Dexterity modifier (minimum 0), and its speed is reduced by a number of feet equal to 5 times your proficiency bonus (to a minimum of 0 feet).Piercing Shot. You fire a shot from your weapon packed with destructive force. It flies in a straight line a number of feet up to your weapon’s normal range. Each creature whose space the ammunition passes through must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes piercing damage equalling a number of d6s equal to your proficiency bonus on a failure, or half as much damage on a success. The shot stops early after it passes through the space of a Huge or larger creature, or through an object more than 1 foot thick or with an AC of 17 or higher.Reeling Blow. You unleash the full force of your Strength and size in a weighty strike. Make an attack roll against a creature within your reach. On a hit, the target suffers the attack’s normal effects and takes extra damage equal to your proficiency bonus. In addition, until the end of its next turn, the creature has disadvantage on all attack rolls, and on ability checks and saving throws that use Dexterity or Intelligence, and it can’t take reactions. In addition, if this attack causes a creature to make a Constitution saving throw to maintain its concentration, the creature has disadvantage on the saving throw.Shield Slam. You smash your shield forward, throwing a creature within your reach off balance. Make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the creature’s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. If you succeed on the contested check, the creature takes bludgeoning damage equalling a number of d8s equal to your proficiency bonus and, until the end of your next turn, melee attacks against the target have advantage.Shockwave. You slam your weapon into the ground at your feet with ruinous force, detonating a shockwave of energy. Each creature within 10 feet of you must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take bludgeoning damage equalling a number of d6s equal to your proficiency bonus and be pushed 10 feet directly away from you.Skewer. In a thrusting strike, you attempt to skewer an enemy with your weapon. Make an attack roll against a creature within your reach. On a hit, the target suffers the attack’s normal effects and is also grappled by you. This grapple ends early if you use the weapon to make another attack or you let go of the weapon. When the grapple ends, the creature takes piercing damage equalling a number of d8s equal to your proficiency bonus.Trip. You perform a wide, sweeping attack that strikes at the footing of enemies around you. Each creature standing within 10 feet of you must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take bludgeoning damage equalling a number of d4s equal to your proficiency bonus and fall prone.Whirling Strike. In a blitzing vortex of aggression, you strike at all those around you in a sinuous assault. Each creature within your reach must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes damage of your weapon’s type equalling a number of d6s equal to your proficiency bonus on a failure, or half as much damage on a success. Success or failure, the creature can’t make opportunity attacks against you until the end of this turn.<img alt=\"Ammunition Mastery.webp\" src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/misc/ammunition-mastery.webp\" target=\"_self\">Several Ammunition advanced techniques let you modify ammunition. A single piece of ammunition can only have a single modification. If it is modified for a second time, it loses any previous modifications it had.Ammunition Property. You can use a weapon that has the Ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a 1 minute to search the battlefield. If you use a weapon that has the Ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.Prerequisites: martial level 2, proficiency with at least one Ammunition weapon\nWhen you finish a short or long rest, you can modify a number of pieces of ammunition equal to twice your proficiency bonus, increasing their aerodynamism. The normal range of attack rolls you make using weapons that use this ammunition is doubled, and the long range increases by half its value.

This technique can’t be used with Loading’s Twin Load.Prerequisites: martial level 10, a tier 2 Ammunition advanced technique\nWhen you finish a short or long rest, you can modify a number of pieces of ammunition equal to your proficiency bonus, choosing from the options below. Explosive. Hit or miss, the target and each creature within 5 feet of it must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target that is hit by your attack automatically fails this saving throw. A creature takes 1d8 thunder damage on a failure, or half as much damage on a success. Smoke Bomb. Hit or miss, the ammunition erupts in a cloud of smoke. The area within 10 feet of the target is heavily obscured until the start of your next turn. When you make an attack with an Ammunition weapon, you can use one of your modified pieces of ammunition, but you can only target creatures or objects within that weapon’s normal range for that attack roll. Any specialised ammunition you create using this technique deteriorates 24 hours after it’s created.Prerequisites: martial level 14, a tier 3 Ammunition advanced technique\nOnce per turn, after you take the Attack action and make an attack with an Ammunition weapon, you can make a DC 15 Dexterity check.

You have advantage on attack rolls made using this piece of ammunition, and your critical hit threshold is reduced by 1 when making attack rolls with it.•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Phosphorous. On a hit, the target takes an extra 3d6 fire damage, emits bright light for 10 feet and dim light for an additional 10 feet, and can’t benefit from being invisible or taking the Hide action. The phosphorus burns for 1 minute, or until the target uses an action to extinguish the flame or is submerged in water.When you make an attack with an Ammunition weapon, you can use one of your modified pieces of ammunition, but you can only target creatures or objects within that weapon’s normal range for that attack roll.

For creatures that roll a die when they make unarmed strikes (such as the monk or Tavern Brawler fighter (see L’Arsene’s Ledger)), the size of their damage die is increased by one (maximum 1d12) when they make unarmed strikes with a hand equipped with a weapon that has this property.*Prerequisite: martial level 2*\nThe second time on your turn that you hit the same creature with an unarmed strike or an attack with a Pugilist weapon, you deal extra damage to it equal to your proficiency bonus.*Prerequisite: martial level 2*\nYou can roll a d6 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strikes. Attacks with Pugilist weapons increase this damage die by one size to a d8.

This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.Prerequisites: martial level 2; proficiency with at least one Reach weapon\nWhile you are wielding a Reach weapon and aren’t restrained or incapacitated, the area within 10 feet of you is difficult terrain for creatures of your choice.Prerequisites: martial level 2; proficiency with at least one Reach weapon\nYou have trained to use your weapon to aid you in vaulting and falling safely. While you are wielding a Reach weapon, if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump, your jumping distance is tripled until the end of this turn. In addition, when you fall and are wielding a Reach weapon, you can subtract up to 50 feet from your fall when calculating falling damage. You can’t gain this benefit if you are unconscious.Prerequisites: martial level 6, a tier 1 Reach advanced technique\nYou can perform a superior strike with any weapon that has the Reach property.Prerequisites: martial level 10, a tier 2 Reach advanced technique\nWhen a creature enters your reach while you are wielding a Reach weapon, you can use your reaction to make an attack against that creature with the weapon.Prerequisites: martial level 10, a tier 2 Reach advanced technique\nWhen you take the Attack action on your turn, the reach of attacks you make with Reach weapons increases by 5 feet until the end of your turn.Prerequisites: martial level 14, a tier 3 Reach advanced technique\nWhen you hit a creature no more than one size larger than you with a Reach weapon, you can move it up to 10 feet horizontally to an unoccupied space.Prerequisites: martial level 14, a tier 3 Reach advanced technique\nWhile you are wielding a Reach weapon and you are within reach of an allied creature who is also wielding a Reach weapon with which it is proficient, you gain a +2 bonus to your AC.

This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it. Like the Reach property, the Scourge property extends your effective attack radius, but through a length of flexible material rather than a long stiff material.*Prerequisites: martial level 2, proficiency with at least one Scourge weapon*\nWhen you hit a creature no more than one size larger than you with an attack using a Scourge weapon on your turn, you can immediately use your bonus action to attempt to pull the target off its feet. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.*Prerequisites: martial level 2, proficiency with at least one Scourge weapon*\nWhen you hit a creature no more than one size larger than you with an attack using a Scourge weapon on your turn, you can immediately use your bonus action to attempt to pull the target. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 10 feet towards you.Prerequisites: martial level 6, a tier 1 Scourge advanced technique\nYou can perform a superior strike with any weapon that has the Scourge property.Prerequisites: martial level 10, a tier 2 Scourge advanced technique\nWhen you hit a creature with an attack roll using a Scourge weapon, you can attempt to disarm that creature. It must make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, the creature drops one object (such as a weapon) that it is holding of your choice, and you pull that weapon or object up to 10 feet towards you.Prerequisites: martial level 10, a tier 2 Scourge advanced technique\nWhen you take the Attack action on your turn, your reach for attacks you make with Scourge weapons increases by 5 feet until the end of your turn.Prerequisites: martial level 14, a tier 3 Scourge advanced technique\nThe damage die of your Scourge weapons increases to a d10.Prerequisites: martial level 14, a tier 3 Scourge advanced technique\nWhen you take the Attack action while wielding a Scourge weapon, you can forgo one attack to make a special melee attack against a creature within the reach of your Scourge weapon. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = your martial save DC). On a failed save, the creature is grappled, and it is restrained while grappled in this way. The creature can escape the grapple if it or a creature within 5 feet of it uses its action to make a Strength check against your martial save DC and succeeds. While a creature is grappled in this way, you can’t attack with your Scourge weapon.<br><img alt=\"Shield Mastery.webp\" src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/misc/shield-mastery.webp\" target=\"_self\">Shield. A shield is typically made from wood or metal and is carried in one hand. Wielding a shield increases your AC by 2. You can benefit from only one shield at a time.*Prerequisites: martial level 2, proficiency with shields*\nWhile you are wielding a shield and within 5 feet of an allied creature that is also wielding a shield, your AC increases by 2. This effect does not stack.*Prerequisites: martial level 2, proficiency with shields*\nWhile you might not intercept every blow, you can cause minor deflections that decrease their efficacy. While you are wielding a shield, when you take damage from an attack, you can reduce the damage you take by an amount equal to your proficiency bonus (no action required). After you use Reinforcement, you can’t use this technique again until the start of your next turn.*Prerequisites: martial level 6, a tier 1 Shield advanced technique*\nYou can perform a superior strike with any shield.*Prerequisites: martial level 10, a tier 2 Shield advanced technique*\nWhile you are wielding a shield and within 5 feet of an allied creature who is not wielding a shield, you can use your bonus action to grant that creature a +2 bonus to its AC until the start of your next turn. The bonus ends early if the creature is ever more than 5 feet away from you or you are incapacitated.*Prerequisites: martial level 10, a tier 2 Shield advanced technique*\nWhen a creature misses you with a melee attack while you are wielding a shield, you can use your reaction to strike its attacking limb, numbing it. The creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or drop the weapon that it used to make the attack (if any) at your feet. In addition, until the end of its next turn, it has disadvantage on attack rolls it makes, and it can’t pick up the weapon while you occupy the space and are not unconscious.*Prerequisites: martial level 14, a tier 3 Shield advanced technique*\nYou are a wall capable of withstanding any onslaught. While you are wielding a shield, when you take damage from an attack, you can reduce the damage you take by an amount equal to your proficiency bonus (no action required). This effect stacks with Reinforcement, allowing you to reduce the damage you take from a melee attack by twice your proficiency bonus. After you use either Bulwark or Reinforcement, you can’t use either technique again until the start of your next turn.*Prerequisites: martial level 14, a tier 3 Shield advanced technique*\nWhen you are wielding a shield and you are targeted by a melee attack by an attacker you can see, but before the GM determines whether the attack roll succeeds or fails, you can use your reaction to add half your proficiency bonus to your AC against that strike, potentially turning a hit into a miss. If the attack misses, you can force the attacker to target a different target that is within 5 feet of both you and the attacking creature with the attack. Use the attacker’s original attack roll to determine if the attack hits.<br><img alt=\"Thrown Mastery.webp\" src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/misc/thrown-mastery.webp\" target=\"_self\">If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.Prerequisites: martial level 2; proficiency with at least one Thrown weapon\nBeing within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesn’t impose disadvantage on your ranged attack rolls made with Thrown weapons.Prerequisites: martial level 2; proficiency with at least one Thrown weapon\nThe normal and long ranges of ranged attacks you make with Thrown weapons is doubled. In addition, if you make a ranged attack with a Thrown weapon while hidden, missing doesn’t reveal your position.Prerequisites: martial level 6, a tier 1 Thrown advanced technique\nYou can perform a superior strike with any weapon that has the Thrown property.Prerequisites: martial level 10, a tier 2 Thrown advanced technique\nIf you make a melee attack with a Thrown weapon on your turn, you can make a ranged weapon attack with that same weapon as a bonus action that turn.Prerequisites: martial level 10, a tier 2 Thrown advanced technique\nAs a bonus action, you can steady your body and mind to give yourself advantage on the next attack roll you make with a Thrown weapon this turn.Prerequisites: martial level 14, a tier 3 Thrown advanced technique\nThe critical threshold of ranged attack rolls you make using Thrown weapons is reduced by 1. If you score a critical hit against a creature with a ranged attack roll using a Thrown weapon, you can choose one of the following additional effects for the target to suffer:\n• The target is blinded until the start of its next turn.\n• The target drops one object (such as a weapon) of your choice that it is holding.\n• The target’s speed is halved until the end of its next turn.Prerequisites: martial level 14, a tier 3 Thrown advanced technique\nAfter you take the Attack action and make a melee attack against a creature on your turn, you gain advantage on attack rolls with Thrown weapons against other creatures until the end of the turn.<br><img alt=\"Versatile Mastery.webp\" src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/misc/versatile-mastery.webp\" target=\"_self\">\nVersatile Property. Versatile weapons can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.Prerequisites: martial level 2, proficiency with at least one Versatile weapon\nWhen a creature makes a melee attack roll against you while you wield a Versatile weapon, you can use your reaction to add your proficiency bonus to your AC against that attack, potentially turning a hit into a miss.Prerequisites: martial level 2, proficiency with at least one Versatile weapon\nYou can use a Versatile weapon as a spellcasting focus, and you can use the hand in which you hold a Versatile weapon to perform the somatic components of spells.Prerequisites: martial level 6, a tier 1 Versatile advanced technique\nYou can perform a superior strike with any weapon that has the Versatile property.Prerequisites: martial level 10, a tier 2 Versatile advanced technique\nWhen you attack with a Versatile weapon using both hands, the size of the weapon's damage die is increased by two steps, rather than one (maximum 1d12).Prerequisites: martial level 10, a tier 2 Versatile advanced technique\nWhen you take the Attack action and hit with a Versatile weapon while wielding a shield, you can use a bonus action to make a melee weapon attack roll using your shield against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 bludgeoning damage and must succeed on a Strength saving throw or fall prone. Creatures more than one size larger than you automatically succeed on this saving throw.Prerequisites: martial level 10, a tier 2 Versatile advanced technique\nIf you take the Attack action on your turn and only attack with a Versatile weapon wielded in one hand, you can attack with that weapon one-handed again as a bonus action. You do not add your ability modifier to the damage for this bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative.Prerequisites: martial level 14, a tier 3 Versatile advanced technique\nWhen you take the Attack action and hit a creature with a Versatile weapon wielded in one hand while your other hand is free, you can attempt to grapple that target as part of that same action.Prerequisites: martial level 14, a tier 3 Versatile advanced technique\nWhile you wield both a shield and Versatile weapon, your ability to deflect attacks is second to none. As a bonus action, you can grant yourself a +1 bonus to AC until the start of your next turn, and opportunity attacks against you have disadvantage until then.Prerequisites: martial level 14, a tier 3 Versatile advanced technique\nWhen you attack with a Versatile weapon using both hands, your critical hit threshold is reduced by 2.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Martial Levels","level":1,"id":"Martial_Levels_0"},{"heading":"New Weapons &amp; Weapon

Attacks","icon":"","description":"Combo attacks are a way for player characters to perform impactful, collaborative actions in combat. Through teamwork, adventurers can perform extraordinary actions and players can experience incredible, cinematic moments, reflecting their characters’ bonds as companions and warriors. Combo attacks are a place for players to explore freely and creatively. The scale and spectacle of a combo attack may vary depending on the level of realism your game adheres to. GMs should use these rules as a guide on balancing combo attacks, working with players to allow them the freedom to craft their own combo attacks in a way that enhances combat.Combo attacks are a “power upgrade” to an adventuring party’s arsenal. These rules are written primarily for players to explore, but the GM may wish to give enemy teams (or other nonplayer characters) access to combo attacks too, evening the playing field with devastating, tactical manoeuvres on both sides. Enemy combo attacks should be saved for significant encounters, used as a storytelling device to communicate the relationship between enemies, prepared in advance so that they can be narrated swiftly and dramatically, and never used more than once per encounter. Enemy combo attacks should never have more than four participants (one instigator and three collaborators).Combo attacks are spectacular moments of synchronised combat virtuosity performed by player characters in combat, and each participant can alter or enhance it in a unique way.A combo attack can be initiated whenever a player character makes an attack roll on their turn and does not have disadvantage on the attack roll. It must be announced before the die is rolled but after the attack is declared. The character who makes that attack is referred to as the instigator. If an instigator attempts to initiate a combo attack and nobody collaborates, a combo attack does not occur.Other player characters who can see the instigator can each use their reaction to enhance the attack by performing a Combo action (presented below). A character who assists in this way is referred to as a collaborator. In the case of a combo attack with more than one collaborator, the collaborators take their reactions in initiative order. Once any collaborators have taken their reactions, the instigator makes their attack roll to finish the combo attack.Some Combo choices (e.g., Unison Onslaught) allow the instigator to roll an extra d20 on its attack and choose the highest result. These stack with advantage. For example, a character that has advantage on an attack roll and has one collaborator use Unison Onslaught rolls 3d20 for its attack roll, and uses the highest result.Once a player character is a collaborator in a combo attack, they can’t collaborate in another combo attack until they finish a long rest. Combo attacks also require participants to be familiar with each other. Only characters who have spent at least one week adventuring together, over which time they observe one another’s fighting style and movements, have the integral knowledge required to perform combo attacks together.There are multiple ways for combo attacks to operate, depending on how those participating in the combo attack assist the instigator. Collaborators within reach of the instigator can enhance the combo attack in different ways to those at a distance, or to those who cast spells. Each Combo action has a prerequisite, usually dictating the maximum distance a collaborator can be from the instigator’s target to assist. For ease of use, Combo actions are divided into Melee, Ranged, and Spellcasting options. Any player character can collaborate using any Combo action, provided they meet the prerequisite and are an ally of the instigator.No matter the Combo action used, the threshold for the instigator to score a critical hit on their initiating attack roll is reduced by 1 for each collaborator assisting them. Usually, a critical hit is scored on a roll of a 20 on the d20. If two player characters collaborate with the instigator on a combo attack, the critical hit threshold is reduced by 2, so the instigator scores a critical hit on a roll of 18, 19, or 20. This stacks with other effects like a Champion fighter’s Improved Critical subclass feature and the Executioner advanced technique from the Heavy advanced weapon mastery tree (see page 94).When you use your reaction to collaborate on a combo attack, you can choose one of the following Combo actions:Prerequisite: The instigator is within your reach and within 5 feet of their target, your carrying capacity is greater than the instigator’s weight, and their target is no more than one size larger than you.Collaborator’s Action. You toss the instigator through the air, over the enemy, allowing them to strike from above and land in a different position.\nCombo Effect. Your unorthodox assault opens up a weakness in the enemy’s guard. The instigator can roll an additional d20 as a part of their attack roll, choosing between it or their own roll. In addition, the instigator lands in an unoccupied space of their choice within 5 feet of their target.Prerequisite: You are within 15 feet of the instigator’s target.Collaborator’s Action. You charge into the fray, tearing the instigator's target’s attention away from your allies and onto yourself. You move towards the target of the instigator's attack, ending your movement as close to them as possible as you distract them with a goading insult.\nCombo Effect. The instigator's target has disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures other than you until the end of the instigator’s next turn.Prerequisite: The instigator and their target are within your reach.Collaborator’s Action. You barrel into the instigator's target, attempting to knock it off balance as your ally strikes. Make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target’s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. If you win the contest, you knock the target prone or shove it 5 feet away from you (your choice). A target two or more sizes larger than you automatically succeeds in this contest.\nCombo Effect. Whether you win the contest or not, your charge serves as a distraction. The instigator can roll an additional d20 as part of their attack roll, choosing between it or their own roll.Prerequisite: The instigator’s target is within your reach.Collaborator’s Action. You make a swift melee weapon attack against the instigator's target, striking in unison with your ally. On a hit, you deal damage as normal, but you don’t add your ability modifier to the damage of the attack, unless that modifier is negative.\nCombo Effect. Whether you hit or miss, your attack serves as a potent distraction. The instigator can roll an additional d20 as a part of their attack roll, choosing between it or their own roll.When you use your reaction to collaborate on a combo attack, you can choose one of the following Combo actions:Prerequisite: The instigator’s target is within range of a ranged or thrown weapon you are wielding.Collaborator’s Action. You attempt to strike an object the instigator's target is holding with a ranged attack, potentially knocking it loose from its grasp.\nCombo Effect. The instigator's target makes a Strength saving throw with disadvantage (DC equals 8 + instigator’s proficiency bonus + instigator’s Strength modifier). On a failed save, it drops one item it is holding (your choice).Prerequisite: The instigator’s target is within range of a ranged or thrown weapon you are wielding.Collaborator’s Action. You make a swift ranged weapon attack, perfectly timed to momentarily distract an enemy. On a hit, you deal your weapon’s damage as normal, but you don’t add your ability modifier to the damage of the attack, unless that modifier is negative.\nCombo Effect. Hit or miss, your attack serves as a potent distraction. The instigator can roll an additional d20 as part of their attack roll, choosing between it or their own roll.Prerequisite: The instigator’s target is within range of a ranged or thrown weapon you are wielding.Collaborator’s Action. You provide a well-timed ranged attack, targeting the space between the instigator and their target, which provides cover for your ally to strike and retreat.\nCombo Effect. The instigator can roll an additional d20 as a part of their attack roll, choosing between it or their own roll. In addition, until the end of the instigator’s turn, they don’t provoke opportunity attacks from their target.A spellcaster can collaborate in a combo attack while they are within 90 feet of the instigator by choosing one spell the spellcaster can cast and expending a spell slot of any level (note: this does not cast a spell). The effect of the combo attack depends on the school of magic the chosen spell belongs to.Prerequisite: You are within 90 feet of the instigator, have an unexpended spell slot, and know or have prepared an abjuration spell of 1st level or higher.Collaborator’s Action. You expend one spell slot. Sparkling magic shimmers around the instigator’s body, fortifying them with temporary, spectral armour.\nCombo Effect. The instigator gains temporary hit points equal to five times the level of the spell slot expended.Prerequisite: You are within 90 feet of the instigator, have an unexpended spell slot, and know or have prepared a biomancy spell of 1st level or higher.Collaborator’s Action. You expend one spell slot. The instigator’s strike is imbued with toxic pathogens.\nCombo Effect. The instigator's target must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. The target has a penalty on its saving throws to avoid or end this effect equal to the level of the spell slot expended. On a failed save, it is poisoned for the next minute. It can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.Prerequisite: You are within 90 feet of the instigator, have an unexpended spell slot, and know or have prepared a conjuration spell of 1st level or higher.Collaborator’s Action. You expend one spell slot. Your magic spirals around the instigator, wrenching them from harm’s way after they make their attack.\nCombo Effect. Immediately after the instigator makes their attack against their target, they can choose to teleport to an unoccupied space that they can see within a number of feet equal to 10 × the level of the spell slot expended.Prerequisite: You are within 90 feet of the instigator, have an unexpended spell slot, and know or have prepared a divination spell of 1st level or higher.Collaborator’s Action. You expend one spell slot. The instigator's senses are enhanced with supernatural precognition.\nCombo Effect. The instigator gains a bonus to all attack rolls and saving throws equal to the level of the spell slot expended until the end of their next turn.Prerequisite: You are within 90 feet of the instigator, have an unexpended spell slot, and know or have prepared an enchantment spell of 1st level or higher.Collaborator’s Action. You expend one spell slot. Hypnotic magic weaves through the force of the instigator’s attack to strike their target’s mind.\nCombo Effect. If the instigator's attack hits their target, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. The target has a penalty on its saving throw equal to the level of the spell slot expended. On a failed save, it is charmed by the instigator until the end of the instigator’s next turn. This effect ends early if the instigator deals any damage to the target.Prerequisite: You are within 90 feet of the instigator, have an unexpended spell slot, and know or have prepared an evocation spell of 1st level or higher.Collaborator’s Action. You expend one spell slot. The instigator’s attack bursts with bright, magical energy.\nCombo Effect. On a hit, the instigator’s attack deals extra acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage, or damage of a type that appears in an evocation spell you can cast (your choice). The extra damage equals 1d10 per level of the spell slot expended.Prerequisite: You are within 90 feet of the instigator, have an unexpended spell slot, and know or have prepared an illusion spell of 1st level or higher.Collaborator’s Action. You expend one spell slot. Spiralling illusions cloak the instigator in darkness, dazzling light, or another visual effect, obscuring their form and movement.\nCombo Effect. The instigator adds a bonus to their attack roll equal to the level of the spell slot expended, and their movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks until the end of the turn.Prerequisite: You are within 90 feet of the instigator, have an unexpended spell slot, and know or have prepared a necromancy spell of 1st level or higher.Collaborator’s Action. You expend one spell slot. Your magic courses through the instigator, wrenching the life-force of their target and channelling it back to the source of the damage.\nCombo Effect. On a hit, the instigator’s attack deals extra necrotic damage equal to 1d6 per level of the spell slot expended. The collaborator then gains temporary hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt by this effect.Prerequisite: You are within 90 feet of the instigator, have an unexpended spell slot, and know or have prepared a transmutation spell of 1st level or higher.Collaborator’s Action. You expend one spell slot. Your magic bursts as a force of raw adrenaline in the instigator.\nCombo Effect. Immediately after completing their attack, the instigator can take another action. This action can only be used to take the Dash, Disengage, Dodge, Hide, or Use an Object action. If you expend a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, this action can instead be used to take the Attack action (grapple or shove only). If you expend a spell slot of 5th level or higher, this action can instead be used to take the Attack action (one weapon attack only) or Cast a Spell action (cantrip only).These Combo actions are suggestions, not an exhaustive list of all combos possible. Players should work with their GM and each other to come up with ideas that play to the unique strengths and idiosyncrasies of their characters. In all cases, players should name their combo attacks a suitably epic name.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Combo Attacks","level":2,"id":"Combo_Attacks_1"},{"heading":"A Deadly Addition","level":3,"id":"A_Deadly_Addition_0"},{"heading":"Performing a Combo Attack","level":2,"id":"Performing_a_Combo_Attack_0"},{"heading":"Initiating a Combo Attack","level":3,"id":"Initiating_a_Combo_Attack_0"},{"heading":"Participating in a Combo Attack","level":3,"id":"Participating_in_a_Combo_Attack_0"},{"heading":"Combos and Advantage","level":3,"id":"Combos_and_Advantage_0"},{"heading":"Limitations","level":3,"id":"Limitations_0"},{"heading":"Combo Actions","level":2,"id":"Combo_Actions_0"},{"heading":"Devastating Strikes","level":3,"id":"Devastating_Strikes_0"},{"heading":"Melee Combos","level":2,"id":"Melee_Combos_0"},{"heading":"Ally Launcher","level":3,"id":"Ally_Launcher_0"},{"heading":"Goading Rush","level":3,"id":"Goading_Rush_0"},{"heading":"Staggering Charge","level":3,"id":"Staggering_Charge_0"},{"heading":"Unison Onslaught","level":3,"id":"Unison_Onslaught_0"},{"heading":"Ranged Combos","level":2,"id":"Ranged_Combos_0"},{"heading":"Disarming Combination","level":3,"id":"Disarming_Combination_0"},{"heading":"Flinchshot","level":3,"id":"Flinchshot_0"},{"heading":"Suppressing Fire","level":3,"id":"Suppressing_Fire_0"},{"heading":"Spellcasting Combos","level":2,"id":"Spellcasting_Combos_0"},{"heading":"Abjuration","level":3,"id":"Abjuration_0"},{"heading":"Biomancy","level":3,"id":"Biomancy_0"},{"heading":"Conjuration","level":3,"id":"Conjuration_0"},{"heading":"Divination","level":3,"id":"Divination_0"},{"heading":"Enchantment","level":3,"id":"Enchantment_0"},{"heading":"Evocation","level":3,"id":"Evocation_0"},{"heading":"Illusion","level":3,"id":"Illusion_0"},{"heading":"Necromancy","level":3,"id":"Necromancy_0"},{"heading":"Transmutation","level":3,"id":"Transmutation_0"},{"heading":"Creating Additional Combos","level":2,"id":"Creating_Additional_Combos_0"}],"links":[],"author":"Rasmus","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/94_character_creation/mechanics/combo-attacks.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1752932405778,"modifiedTime":1752934096960,"sourceSize":16185,"sourcePath":"94_Character_Creation/Mechanics/Combo Attacks.md","exportPath":"94_character_creation/mechanics/combo-attacks.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":285,"backlinks":["index.html"],"type":"markdown"},"94_character_creation/mechanics/cooking.html":{"title":"Cooking","icon":"","description":"Cooking is a subcategory of crafting that allows players to use their downtime to prepare for the conflict ahead in a whole new way. This section explores cooking magical food. It first describes the rules for cooking food, then details the 22 staple recipes and 10 boss-monster-specific recipes, before finishing by diving into the myriad different effects of edible monster components.Like crafting, cooking uses harvested monster components to impart magical effects on food, known as magical meals. When consumed and digested, magical meals have long-lasting magical effects. These effects vary based on two factors: the type of component (for example, eye vs blood), and the creature type that the component came from (an aberration’s eye has different properties to a dragon’s eye). Different recipes call for different types of ingredients; a black pudding requires just blood, while offal stew needs a liver, heart, and brain. The more ingredients a magical meal calls for, the more effects it imparts simultaneously, and the harder it is to cook.A magical meal takes 1 hour to cook and 10 minutes to consume and digest. A magical meal must be fully consumed within 1 hour of being cooked; if it is eaten after this hour, it imparts no magical effects. The effects last 8 hours, or until dispelled by dispel magic or similar magic. A creature that eats a magical meal while already under the effects of another loses the effects of the previous meal at the end of the 10 minutes required to consume the new meal.Portions. A magical meal is typically large enough to feed one Large creature or up to four Medium or smaller creatures. If you have more than four players at your table, consider allowing a\nsingle meal to have enough portions to feed the entire party; it can be more fun that way. Checks. Making a magical meal requires five things:\nA recipe\nMonster components\nEssence\nCook’s utensils\nA source of heat\nA creature with all these in their possession can spend 1 hour cooking. At the conclusion of the hour, the creature makes a Constitution (cook’s utensils) check against the DC of the recipe (see Ingredients and Recipe DC table). Depending on the difference between the DC and the result of the check, a magical meal can have quirks (see page 147).\nHelping Hands. Too many cooks spoil the broth, but a decent sous chef can pay dividends. For this reason, in place of using the Help action to grant advantage (a mechanic avoided in harvesting and crafting), one creature can help with the meal if it spends the entire hour helping the cook. If the creature has proficiency with cook’s utensils, it adds its proficiency bonus to the result of the Constitution (cook’s utensils) check. If it doesn’t have this proficiency, it adds half of its proficiency bonus to the result of the check instead.For the purposes of the dispel magic spell, all of a meal’s effects count as one single spell of a level based on the meal’s rarity: uncommon, 2nd-level; rare, 4th-level; very rare, 6th-level; legendary, 8th level.This book presents two types of recipes: staple ones which can be cooked with monster components of any type, and ‘boss recipes’ which require components specific to the boss monsters in the hunts in this book. It is up to the GM whether player characters know these recipes, or must discover them. You could introduce recipes in ancient tomes, give them to a character whose grandfather was a famous chef, or make them purchasable from magical restaurants or culinary schools. Discuss this with your table before you introduce this ruleset.Potency and Essence. Essence is required for every magical meal; it is the factor that decides how powerful the meal’s effects will be. As with crafting, essence dictates the rarity of the magical meal, from uncommon to legendary. Rarity’s effect on magical meals is described in on pages 142 through 146.Edible Components. The components in the harvesting chapter marked with a superscript ‘E’ (E)\nare edible—they all have magical effects if properly prepared. There are 10 types of edible components: blood, bone, brain, egg, eye, fat, flesh, heart, liver, and spice. Not all creature types supply every type of edible component. For a breakdown of each component type’s effects, see pages 142 to 146. Any unlisted nonmagical ingredients are supplied from a player character’s normal rations, and don’t require detailing.Difficulty. The more ingredients a recipe has, the more magical effects it imparts to those who consume it, and the higher the DC is to craft it. There are four tiers of difficulty:*No heat source required.Omitting Ingredients. A cook can replace a magical ingredient with a nonmagical one. If they choose to do so, they don’t get the associated magical effect of the nonmagical component, but can still attempt to craft the meal. For example, if a creature wants to make a scarlet eye flan, but has no magical blood, they can use the blood of any creature (provided it hasn’t spoiled) to complete the recipe. The DC for the recipe doesn’t change, and the magical meal only imparts the effects of the three magical components used: brain, eye, and fat.Boss Monster recipes confer unique effects in addition to the effects of the components that make up the recipes. For example, aboleth ramen gives you the effect of aboleth flesh (bonus psychic damage) and the additional effect granted from consuming the boss dish (increased reach).For the duration of the magical meal’s effects, a creature that consumes and digests the meal gains\nthe following additional effect, with a value shown in the Boss Monster Effect Scaling table:When you make a melee weapon attack on your turn, your reach with it is greater than normal. This distance increases with rarity.Immediately after you take damage, you gain resistance to that damage type for the next 1 minute. The number of resistances you can have from this effect simultaneously increases with rarity. If you are at your maximum number of resistances, you can’t gain more.You know the direction and distance of all corpses within a certain radius of you. This radius increases with rarity. The effect can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.You can’t be affected or detected by spells of a certain spell level or lower unless you wish to be. The level of spells affected increases with rarity.Your power of self-belief is so strong that, at the start of each of your turns, you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). The number of temporary hit points gained increases with rarity.You can use an action to transform into a piece of furniture equal to your size, or back to your normal form. While transformed, you have a walking speed of 5 feet, can’t take any action other than the Dash action or the action to change back into your normal form, and otherwise retain your game statistics.A creature can use its action to make an Intelligence (Investigation) check to inspect you, realizing you are a transformed creature on a success. The DC increases with rarity.When you are hit by a nonmagical, ferrous weapon, the damage you take is reduced. The value of this damage reduction increases with rarity. This reduction occurs before resistance is calculated.You can cast the daydream spell (see page 501) once, without requiring any components, and regain the ability to cast it this way after 1 hour has passed. The saving throw DC increases with rarity.You regain a number of hit points at the end of each hour you spend in sunlight. The number of hit points regained increases with rarity.If you take damage from a spell or other magical effect, you become empowered. The next attack you make within the next 1 minute that hits a target deals additional necrotic damage. This damage increases with rarity.You can choose to make these boss monster recipes available as staple recipes as well. If you do so, the boss monster ingredient can be replaced with another ingredient of the same type (for example, a different flesh instead of the broodmother tentacle).If this replacement occurs, the additional effect of the dish (the one based on the boss monster ingredient) is not conferred to a creature that eats the meal.This section lists the ten types of edible components alphabetically, breaking down the effects by creature type. If a creature type isn’t listed for an edible component, that component isn’t magical for that creature. For example, humanoid flesh has no magical effects, and thus isn’t listed as a harvestable component, but could still be acquired as a non-magical foodstuff.\nThe effects are worded as addressing the creature that has consumed and digested the magical meal. If an effect puts the creature ‘under the effect of a spell’, this spell does not require concentration, but can be dispelled. The Edible Monster Component Summary table on the next page describes the types of edible magical components available from each creature type.Blood gives its ingester a taste for certain creature types. For the duration, the first time each turn that you hit a creature whose type matches the creature type of the blood you consumed, the attack deals bonus damage to the target. The damage is of the same type as the attack and increases with rarity: uncommon, 1d4; rare, 1d6; very rare, 1d8; legendary, 1d10.The vitality stored within bones reinforces a creature’s resilience to certain types of effects. Except for celestial and undead bones, the effects don’t change with rarity. For the duration, you:Aberration\nHave advantage on saving throws against the stunned condition.Beast\nHave advantage on saving throws against the blinded condition.Celestial\nGain temporary hit points at the start of each minute, which increases with rarity.Construct\nHave advantage on saving throws against gaining levels of exhaustion.Dragon\nHave advantage on saving throws against the frightened condition.Elemental\nHave advantage on saving throws against extreme weather and temperature.Fey\nHave advantage on saving throws against the charmed condition.Fiend\nHave advantage on saving throws against the poisoned condition.Giant\nHave advantage on saving throws against the restrained condition.Humanoid\nHave advantage on saving throws against diseases.Monstrosity\nHave advantage on saving throws against the paralysed condition.Plant\nCan’t be put to sleep by magic.Undead\nHave advantage on saving throws against diseases. Additionally, you immediately regain a number of hit points, which increases with rarity.Digesting brains imparts enhanced mental faculties. Of the edible brains, aberrations and humanoids have particularly unique abilities. For the duration, you:Aberration\nYou must be able to see the creature and share a language to communicate in this way.\nCan communicate telepathically with creatures within a certain radius of you, which increases with rarity. In addition, higher rarities grant you advantage on Insight checks (very rare and legendary) and put you under the effects of the detect thoughts spell (legendary).Celestial\nGain a bonus to Charisma checks, which increases with rarity.Construct\nGain a bonus to Intelligence checks, which increases with rarity.Fey\nGain a bonus to Wisdom checks, which increases with rarity.Fiend\nGain a bonus to Charisma checks, which increases with rarity.Humanoid\nGain a bonus to ability checks using a single randomly determined skill (see the Random Skill table on page 120). The bonus increases with rarity.Eggs contain the primed biomantic material for creatures of the component’s type. When you ingest a meal that contains egg, your body undergoes interesting morphological changes that last for the effect’s duration.Aberration\nYou grow a tentacle that can be used to hold non-armour items, or to grapple a creature, but not to make other attacks. You use the tentacle’s Strength modifier instead of your own when grappling with it. The Strength modifier of the tentacle increases with rarity.Beast\nYour morphology changes to adapt to the current environment. You have advantage on saving throws against environmental effects of the GM’s discretion. For example, if you are in a cold biome, you might grow fur and have advantage on saving throws against the effects of the cold.Dragon\nYou grow a fanged maw, a natural weapon which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with it, you deal piercing damage equal to a value that increases with rarity + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.Fey\nYou shimmer while standing still, becoming hard to see. You are under the effects of the chameleon skin spell.Monstrosity\nYou grow scales that grant you a new way to calculate your AC. The calculation increases with rarity. You can use the calculation to determine your AC if the armour you wear would leave you with a lower AC.Eyes are strong receptacles of divination magic, and they tend to impart effects that help with perception and detection. For the duration, you:Aberration\nAre under the effects of the detect magic spell. The radius of the sense increases with rarity.Beast\nGain a bonus to your Perception checks. The bonus increases with rarity.Celestial\nAre under the effects of the detect evil and good spell. The radius of the sense increases with rarity.Dragon\nGain a bonus to your Intimidation checks. The bonus increases with rarity.Elemental\nKnow the location of any elemental within a radius around you that isn’t protected from divination magic. The radius increases with rarity.Fey\nAre under the effects of the see invisibility spell, out to a certain range. The range of the vision increases with rarity.Fiend\nCan see normally in dim light and darkness, both magical and nonmagical. The radius of the vision increases with rarity.Monstrosity\nGain darkvision or, if you already have darkvision, its range is increased. The range of the vision increases with rarity.Undead\nKnow the location of any undead within a radius around you that isn’t protected from divination magic. The radius increases with rarity.Fat inures creatures to particular types of damage, decreasing the trauma caused when a creature takes damage of that type. Whenever you take damage of the type associated with the creature type whose fat you ingested, roll a die and subtract the result from that damage. The die is determined by the rarity: uncommon, 1d4; rare, 1d6; very rare, 1d8; legendary, 1d10. This damage reduction occurs before resistance is calculated.Aberration\nPsychicBeast\nColdCelestial\nRadiantConstruct\nLightningDragon\nMeta; the same as the damage type of the dragon’s Breath Weapon. If a dragon possesses Breath Weapons that deal multiple damage types, the damage type is randomly determined from among the available options.

A well or badly made magical meal can end up with quirks—properties that grant additional favourable or detrimental effects. Unhelpful quirks are known as flaws, while advantageous ones are referred to as boons. The greater the margin by which a crafting check is failed or succeeded, the greater the number of quirks acquired. The number of boons a magical meal can gain is limited by the power of the essence used to craft it: the rarer the essence, the more boons it can sustain. A food’s quirks are rolled by the GM and aren’t known by those who consume the food until they become apparent. Cooking quirks are described later in this section (page 148).Repeated Results\nCooking quirks don’t stack; if you roll the same quirk more than once, re-roll until you get a different result.To determine which flaws the meal has, roll on the Cooking Flaws table Unless otherwise stated, any effects last for the duration of the magical meal’s effects.To determine which boons the meal has, roll on the Cooking Boons table Unless otherwise stated, any effects last for the duration of the magical meal’s effects.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Magical Cuisine","level":1,"id":"Magical_Cuisine_0"},{"heading":"Apply Heat, Don’t Burn","level":1,"id":"Apply_Heat,_Don’t_Burn_0"},{"heading":"Dispelling Magical Meals","level":2,"id":"Dispelling_Magical_Meals_0"},{"heading":"Recipes","level":1,"id":"Recipes_0"},{"heading":"Ingredients and Recipe DC","level":2,"id":"Ingredients_and_Recipe_DC_0"},{"heading":"Stable Recipes","level":2,"id":"Stable_Recipes_0"},{"heading":"Novice Recipes","level":3,"id":"Novice_Recipes_0"},{"heading":"Journeyman Recipes","level":3,"id":"Journeyman_Recipes_0"},{"heading":"Expert Recipes","level":3,"id":"Expert_Recipes_0"},{"heading":"Artisan Recipes","level":3,"id":"Artisan_Recipes_0"},{"heading":"Boss Monster Recipes","level":2,"id":"Boss_Monster_Recipes_0"},{"heading":"Boss Monster Recipes","level":3,"id":"Boss_Monster_Recipes_1"},{"heading":"<strong>Aboleth Ramen</strong>","level":4,"id":"**Aboleth_Ramen**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>Jello Shot</strong>","level":4,"id":"**Jello_Shot**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>Mushroom Mélange</strong>","level":4,"id":"**Mushroom_Mélange**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>Rakoyaki</strong>","level":4,"id":"**Rakoyaki**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>Scrapyard Sosig</strong>","level":4,"id":"**Scrapyard_Sosig**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>Tongue Twister Tart</strong>","level":4,"id":"**Tongue_Twister_Tart**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>Magnetite Curry</strong>","level":4,"id":"**Magnetite_Curry**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>Dumpleyengs</strong>","level":4,"id":"**Dumpleyengs**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>Suneater Steak &amp;

Some go so far as to suggest that they are far t oo trusting and lack any caution in dealing with outsiders - a trait that has led to tragedy more than once. Despite this, cappy society never loses its optimistic glimmer for long as steadfast refusal to judge the many by the few stands as one of the pillars of their community. Though repeat offenders are given little leeway before enough is enough and even the cappy are driven to anger. They are uniformly vegetarian, highly social and seem to possess a natural affinity for the simple creatures that exist alongside them. Cappy populaces are usually gentle and unassuming communities, rarely committing to violence in any meaningful way, but are often made up of farmers, fisherfolk, priests and affable wayfarers offering aid to wayfarers in need. Cappy communities are almost exclusively located near large bodies of fresh water, in which family groups spend much of their time each day. Those rare few that are located elsewhere have large common bathing facilities that utilize water conjured by magic or simply carriedBathing areas are important community locations where cappy villagers meet and make collective decisions in a relaxed environment. Decisions are by consensus, and the cappy are known for never explicitly arguing – an atmosphere that can be either relaxing or infuriating to a participant, depending on their stake in what is being discussed. by hand overland. Cappy kept away from their beloved baths for too long are prone to uncharacteristic irritability brought about by parasites or skin lesions.Cappy have an innate empathy for living creatures that puts beasts as ease around them. Even normally dangerous, wild creatures have been known to traipse into and laze about their villages without any hint of aggression towards the villagers or other creatures in the vicinity. For their part, the cappy welcome these visits as minor blessings from the Asura and happily allow these creatures to come and go as they please. Cappy can learn to use their natural affinity for animals to communicate with and to some extent direct animals’ behavior, though they avoid doing so if it will cause the animals to come to harm. If threatened, a cappy often calls upon nearby animals to distract and harass their enemies, allowing them to escape or otherwise avoid danger.A cappy community’s response to aggression is consistent with their members’ earnest and peaceful disposition; they far prefer flight to fight and usually try to withdraw rather than cause harm. Though when circumstance forces the issue, a cappy takes up arms as readily as any - but usually only long enough to give them and their comrades a chance to flee. Cappy martial artists are even renowned across Tooj for specializing in techniques that misdirect or delay foes rather than cause injury. Harming or even killing another creature is seen as a dire taboo by many cappy, with those who commit such acts – even accidentally – often withdrawing from their communities in penance. Due to this philosophy, cappy are rarely found adventuring. When they are, it’s usually as healers or sages with practical views regarding the necessity of their and their companions’ work, or they were raised outside of cappy communities. In rare cases, they might even be pariahs who have turned away from cappy culture at large in the face of a dire threat.Favored Ability Score. Wisdom and Charisma. Increase one by 2 and the other by 1.\nAge. Cappy mature quickly, reaching adulthood in 10 years. They are also relatively short-lived with a lifespan of about 60 years.\nAlignment. Friendly and outgoing, cappy tend toward good alignment, and are usually more concerned with fairness and neutrality when it comes to law versus chaos.\nSize. Cappy average about three and a half feet in height and around 70 pounds in weight. Your size is Small.\nSpeed. You have a walking speed of 30 feet and a swimming speed of 15 feet.\nAnimal Empathy. As an action, you focus on one beast within 30 feet of you. Through gentle murmurs and calm movements, you convey simple ideas to the beast and gain a sense of what the beast most wants in the situation. You might be able to persuade a beast to perform a small favor for you, at your GM’s discretion.\nBeast Whisperer. As an action, you may utter soothing words towards a nearby animal. Choose one beast that can see you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw with a DC of 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is charmed by you for 1 minute or until it takes damage. While it is charmed by you, it is friendly to you and your allies.\nLanguages. You can speak, read, and write Common and one language of your choice.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#race"],"headers":[{"heading":"Cappy","level":1,"id":"Cappy_1"},{"heading":"Water Lovers","level":2,"id":"Water_Lovers_0"},{"heading":"Kin to All","level":2,"id":"Kin_to_All_0"},{"heading":"Only to Defend","level":2,"id":"Only_to_Defend_0"},{"heading":"Cappy Traits","level":1,"id":"Cappy_Traits_0"}],"links":[],"author":"Rasmus","coverImageURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se","fullURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/94_character_creation/races/cappy.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":["00_attachments/raceimages/cappy-paladin.webp","00_attachments/raceimages/cappy-ranger.webp","00_attachments/raceimages/cappy-druid.webp"],"createdTime":1739196622256,"modifiedTime":1765273665364,"sourceSize":5460,"sourcePath":"94_Character_Creation/Races/Cappy.md","exportPath":"94_character_creation/races/cappy.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":289,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"94_character_creation/races/cnidaran.html":{"title":"Cnidaran","icon":"","description":"<img alt=\"Cnidaran.webp\" src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/raceimages/cnidaran.webp\" target=\"_self\">From nomadic, floating cities whose coral exoskeletons stretch down into the dark ocean depths to mile-long reefs and small atolls, cnidaran (NI-da-ran) settlements can be found wherever salt meets water. Their unique, bipartite lifecycle sets them apart from most other humanoids and fosters a zealous loyalty between cnidaran and home.Cnidarans have two distinct phases to their lifecycle: the medusozoa and the polyp. An adventuring cnidaran—one that can speak, has a vaguely humanoid shape, and can manipulate tools—is a medusozoa. These individuals are responsible for interacting with the outside world (in other words, anything beyond their home reef).When medusozoa mate, an event that can involve dozens of individuals, the thousands of larvae that are conceived settle on the nearest substrate, often the cnidarans’ own coral home. Once rooted, the larvae develop into polyps with two tasks. The first is to grow a single new medusozoa over a single moon’s cycle and then birth this inch-long, instinct-driven youngster into the waters surrounding its home . The second is to secrete a calcareous exoskeleton, fusing their body with the reef and growing the cnidarans’ coral home .Life for a young medusozoa is tenuous; it must fend for itself, drifting in open waters and feeding on plankton and other medusozoa until it reaches at least a foot in length, usually by the end of its third year. During this juvenile stage, a time known as the uko’ulush (the ‘wild time’), a medusozoa is largely ignored by other cnidarans, who believe that “trial by ocean makes the hardest pearls.” Once a cnidaran completes this juvenile stage, it is brought into the reef, a utilitarian and communal space where the customs, culture, and values of that reef are passed on, the uko’malang (the ‘time of waiting’).Cnidarans live communally . With the practices of mass mating and random dispersal, no single medusozoa knows which individuals are their parents . In fact, the entire concept of ‘parentage’, ‘hereditary titles’, and ‘inheritance’ is foreign to most cnidarans .When a cnidaran medusozoa reaches maturity, it is given the choice to leave the reef with the blessing of the whole community, a once-in-a-lifetime event known as the uko’fa (the ‘time of exploration’). Individuals that start on the uko’fa do so for a multitude of reasons . Some seek to bring back treasures from the world beyond and enhance their own community . Others feel a need to disperse, finding other reefs to join or even forming new reefs with like-minded medusozoa met on their travels . A very few become enraptured by wanderlust and spend the rest of their days among winding ocean currents, delving into damp dungeons, and cavorting in ports with other seadogs .Cnidaran settlements are alive. Made of the bodies of millions of calcified polyps—cnidaran ancestors—a reef is more than just a home; it is the collective memory of a thousand generations, a traceable web of genealogical history, and an esteemed and holy sanctuary . Intentionally damaging a reef carries grave consequences: death, exile, or declarations of war are all sanctions a cnidaran colony might employ . It isn’t unusual for trade unions to pay handsome reparations if a ship damages a cnidaran reef when blown off course by wild winds. To do otherwise might result in ships foundering even in fair and pleasant conditions, such is the whim of an enraged cnidaran reef.As a cnidaran, you have the following racial traits.Named after their whip-like appendage which can secrete a potent neurotoxin, such individuals form the warriors of a cnidaran reef.Diplomats and traders of a cnidaran reef are often shimmerskin morphs; their propensity to mesmerise makes them skilled negotiators.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#race"],"headers":[{"heading":"Cnidaran Info","level":1,"id":"Cnidaran_Info_0"},{"heading":"Disperse and Deploy","level":2,"id":"Disperse_and_Deploy_0"},{"heading":"Commune and Community","level":2,"id":"Commune_and_Community_0"},{"heading":"No Place Like Home","level":2,"id":"No_Place_Like_Home_0"},{"heading":"Cnidaran Traits","level":1,"id":"Cnidaran_Traits_0"},{"heading":"Nematocyst","level":2,"id":"Nematocyst_0"},{"heading":"Shimmerskin","level":2,"id":"Shimmerskin_0"}],"links":[],"author":"Rasmus","coverImageURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/raceimages/cnidaran.webp","fullURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/94_character_creation/races/cnidaran.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":["00_attachments/raceimages/cnidaran.webp"],"createdTime":1739196622153,"modifiedTime":1765273670142,"sourceSize":15563,"sourcePath":"94_Character_Creation/Races/Cnidaran.md","exportPath":"94_character_creation/races/cnidaran.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":290,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"94_character_creation/races/cyclopian.html":{"title":"Cyclopian","icon":"","description":"<img alt=\"Cyclopian.webp\" src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/raceimages/cyclopian.webp\" target=\"_self\">The pursuit of knowledge, the acquisition of secrets, and the hoarding of trinkets with storied\nhistories are common practices among any creature raised by cyclopians (sy-CLO-pee-ans). From dog tags to tapestries, musical manuscripts to carved tablets, and magical memory orbs to worthless heirlooms, their ‘libraries’ (as cyclopians refer to their homes) are filled with knowledge. With their physical adaptation to climbing, cyclopian homes are often found high up in cliffsides, within abandoned wizards’ towers, or deep in The Low.A cyclopian’s singular eye is the perfect metaphor for this race’s almost-myopic tendency to focus\non one thing to the exclusion of all others. When a cyclopian finds a topic that interests them, little\ncan stop their manic and feverish efforts to acquire any relevant documents, information, or answers. Indeed, the famed cyclopian researcher Roza “Thanks” Thanklinds is rumoured to have forgone sleep for more than two months while analysing the crystallised mut-x from the former laboratory of Dr Frank N. Stein. Of course, this feat was made all the easier thanks to cyclopians’ ability to metabolise knowledge into actual, physical, nutritional value.Cyclopians are often mistaken for shadowy aberrations of the Shadow Plane known as nothings.\nWhile both cyclopian and nothings share a hulking monocular physiology and a hunger for knowledge, a brief observation yields one significant difference: the skulking simulacra leave a trail of rot and necrosis wherever they travel, while no true cyclopian would ever risk damaging a book in this way.Cyclopians of a certain age often embark on a Pilgrimage of Huge Discovery, or PHD . During this time, they venture out into the world, seeking to bring new and significant knowledge back to their library. For some individuals, the natural compulsion to explore is all the impetus they need to leave the comfort of their homes. On the other hand, more reticent cyclopians might have to be forced out by their family, fulfilling this rite of passage based on a sense of duty. Cyclopians who fixate on the acquisition of artifacts, rather than the joy of studying them, are regarded as rare and valuable assets to any family; cyclopian adventurers are always warmly welcomed back to their library.Cyclopians have an unusual lifecycle. Though they can reproduce sexually, cyclopians are also capable of a form of asexual budding. When a cyclopian is beyond inundated by the volume of knowledge awaiting its analysis (such as after it gains entry into an abandoned, book-filled wizard’s tower), it can spontaneously and unexpectedly undergo entire body mitosis . This produces a smaller, similar, genetically distinct, individual—an assistant with whom the research can be more manageably catalogued.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#race"],"headers":[{"heading":"Cyclopian Info","level":1,"id":"Cyclopian_Info_0"},{"heading":"Monocular and Myopic","level":2,"id":"Monocular_and_Myopic_0"},{"heading":"Arcanists Analogue","level":2,"id":"Arcanists_Analogue_0"},{"heading":"Pilgrimage of Huge Discovery","level":2,"id":"Pilgrimage_of_Huge_Discovery_0"},{"heading":"Sharing is Caring","level":2,"id":"Sharing_is_Caring_0"}],"links":[],"author":"Rasmus","coverImageURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/raceimages/cyclopian.webp","fullURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/94_character_creation/races/cyclopian.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":["00_attachments/raceimages/cyclopian.webp"],"createdTime":1739197103829,"modifiedTime":1765273674256,"sourceSize":8044,"sourcePath":"94_Character_Creation/Races/Cyclopian.md","exportPath":"94_character_creation/races/cyclopian.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":291,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"94_character_creation/races/enkoh.html":{"title":"Enkoh","icon":"","description":"<img alt=\"Enkoh.webp\" src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/raceimages/enkoh.webp\" target=\"_self\">Beneath snow-capped peaks, where white drifts bury the chaos of rocks and streams, the formidable enkoh make cities of ice and snow. Well-adapted to colder climes, these thick-furred simian folk blend an innate skill for survival with a piercing intelligence, making homes in inhospitable environments.Enkoh have a transformative effect on their environment, domesticating beasts, curtailing avalanches, and building sprawling towns. With singular intent, enkoh collaborate to form a unified community capable of raising a city from the icy wastes in a matter of months. Their realms can be found within vast glaciers and snowfields, boasting soul-soothing hot springs and serving steaming winter cider fermented inside the trunks of hibernating trees. Few enkoh structures are ancient; the ephemeral nature of ice and slow creeping of glaciers means only those structures in the coldest, flattest expanses are over a few hundred years old. This transient nature leads enkoh to value their kith and kin—their troop—over any single location, and has made them masters of ice-crafting. With saw and skin, enkoh cut and melt ice just enough so that it forms solid bonds upon re-freezing. This method produces edifices of fantastical shapes; indeed, enkoh architecture is widely regarded as some of the most beautiful in the Yokai Realms by the few foreign eyes to have seen it.Masters of ice-craft, enkoh guard their crafting secrets fiercely and rarely trade anything more than the essentials with other races. Though it is rare for an enkoh to leave their troop, the lure of master crafters specialising in metal and stone, as well as tales of verdant, sprawling landscapes not cloaked in ice, can lead some into lives of adventure. Fewer still return to their troop, but those that do are warmly welcomed and can expect a peaceful old age in return for sharing the wisdom of their travels.Every bit as rugged, resolute, and unflinching as the frigid mountains they call home, hulking enkoh are known for their fierce, calculating minds and explosive physical strength. Rarely do hulking enkoh act swiftly; they prefer to assess, analyse, and contemplate before choosing a path. However, when moved to action, the mountains move with them.Vibrant, dynamic, and swift, springtail enkoh are the more sociable of their race. Their bonds of fellowship extend to the environment around them; they are masters of taming beasts of land and sky for both work and companionship. Rarely sitting still, springtails walk, speak, and trust quickly.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#race"],"headers":[{"heading":"Enkoh Info","level":1,"id":"Enkoh_Info_0"},{"heading":"Community and Craftsmanship","level":1,"id":"Community_and_Craftsmanship_0"},{"heading":"Troops of Solitude","level":1,"id":"Troops_of_Solitude_0"},{"heading":"Enkoh Traits","level":2,"id":"Enkoh_Traits_0"},{"heading":"Hulking","level":3,"id":"Hulking_0"},{"heading":"Springtail","level":3,"id":"Springtail_0"}],"links":[],"author":"Rasmus","coverImageURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/raceimages/enkoh.webp","fullURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/94_character_creation/races/enkoh.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":["00_attachments/raceimages/enkoh.webp"],"createdTime":1752934548949,"modifiedTime":1765273676499,"sourceSize":15074,"sourcePath":"94_Character_Creation/Races/Enkoh.md","exportPath":"94_character_creation/races/enkoh.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":292,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"94_character_creation/races/etherean.html":{"title":"Etherean","icon":"","description":"<img alt=\"Etherean.webp\" src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/raceimages/etherean.webp\" target=\"_self\">Relishing the taste of fresh mead and flavorful bread, Linnit’s long, slender legs swung happily off the sides of the worn barstool. His colorful, silken tunic shimmered in the lantern’s warm firelight, which seemed to be at odds with the tuft of misty blue hair that danced atop his head. Nimble, gray fingers plucked carefully at his food to make sure that any crumbs and spills were kept to a minimum.Linnit’s smile was easy and disarming, for it was the grin of a person experiencing the simple joys of life for the first time. Although he had grown up not too far from this tavern, no one there had ever seen him there before today. He, on the other hand, already knew everyone’s names and stories, but had been cautioned by his mother to keep that information to himself. After all, he’d been coming here for decades.As he finished counting the coins from his purse, Linnit’s eyes flicked to the side at something that only he could see. He broadened his smile and waved before handing the coins over to the man behind the bar.“Thank you for the meal, Roark. It was, truly, the best I’ve ever had.”“Thank yeh kindly, stranger. Safe travels,” said Roark with a nod as he began to clean.Linnit chuckled as he slid his slender frame off the stool and onto the sticky floor to pick up his belongings. With a final smile, he made his way to the door.Ethereans are, as their name would suggest, the unlikely settlers of the Border Ethereal. They grow up expe- riencing the Material Plane from a distance, viewing it through the gray and muffling barrier between the planes of existence. Most ethereans live in small com- munities spread throughout the Border Ethereal and find joy in poetry, art, and theater that offsets the drab and relative lifelessness of their home. While only a few monsters are able to threaten those on the Border Ethereal, etherean survival is only maintainable through their tenacity and shared sense of decency. For many ethereans, the relative safety of the Ethereal Plane outweighs the richer experiences of the Material, but for those that do manage to cross that planar threshold, there is simply no comparison. Ethereans resemble elves with light gray skin, but their hair and eyes are distinctly different. Many ethereans’ eyes and hair are either purple or magenta, but it’s not unheard of for them to come in a full spectrum of col- ors—a curious result of living extensively on the Ethe- real Plane. Further, an etherean’s hair drifts and floats on its own, as if carried by an invisible current, before evaporating into nothing at its ends.The Border Ethereal allows for a free range of move- ment in any direction, including through solid objects located on the Material Plane. As a result, privacy is ex- tremely coveted by those on the Ethereal Plane, who are constantly aware of the near-impossibility of complete safety from others. Over generations, etherean culture has grown to uphold and teach a powerful focus on common decency between them. This often translates to relatively lawful communities among ethereans, who expect that their safety and privacy will be respected in exchange for their own adherence.\nHowever, whether it be the result of a possible fey ancestry or defiance of their strict social structure, most ethereans have a deep appreciation of harmless pranks and practical jokes. In general, as long as it’s in good fun, moments of levity like these are part of the fabric that keeps ethereans happy and entertained in an otherwise quiet and dull world.Most ethereans are eager to make friends that aren’t other ethereans and eschew sweeping generalizations. Earnest and excitable, ethereans make for spectacular traveling companions for people who enjoy conversations and storytelling.Ethereans typically take up adventuring when the routine of the Border Ethereal no longer interests them. Such ethereans often go searching for a means of travel into the Material Plane, but only some manage to find them. Those that do are thrust into a world suddenly bound by gravity and rife with danger, but also filled with opportunity and new experiences. Many ethereans will happily accept contracts to travel great distances or visit exotic realms, regardless of danger, in order to make the most of their life beyond the Border Ethereal.\nEthereans will often choose to spend their coin on brightly colored and ostentatious clothing, seemingly making up for the limited color palettes they may have experienced on the Border Ethereal. Others fall victim to new vices, but more often than not, strict etherean resourcefulness is enough to prevent all but the most vulnerable ethereans from becoming addicted to the pleasures of the Material Plane.An etherean has a given name, a family name, and possibly a nickname. Etherean nicknames often sound purposefully silly, and are just as likely to be self-given as they are by friends or family. Given Names: Antham, Cheyl, Corifir, Crena, Destva, Euranya, Genoven, Hanshen, Hosh, Irsht, Jeun, Kline, Krimme, Luddin, Osvo, Ozla, Pragil, Prinn, Quord, Tresht, Tryll, Ulram, Ura, Vass, VertraFamily Names: Atvash, Brenniwick, Orelet, Ouly, Pientrafit, Promuna, Reffra, Wrenylin, Yrelift, ZuchaWhen creating your etherean character, use these traits as a guide, rather than a rule. A typical etherean is naturally charismatic, which is reflected in the Ability Score Increase trait, but yours may be quiet or reserved by comparison. In this case, increase one ability score of your choice by 2 and another by 1, or choose three different ability scores to increase by 1.\nSimilarly, your etherean may never have ascribed to the rigors of etherean society and has fully embraced their chaotic leanings. And, like all humanoids, size is hardly a defining factor: when you select this race, you can choose to be Small, instead of Medium.\nLastly, the suggested age trait is just that: a suggestion. In your world, the ethereans' fey ancestry may be more evident, resulting in a longer life span. Regardless, the life span of most player characters in fifth edition is about a century—presuming they don’t meet a violent end on an adventure.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#race"],"headers":[{"heading":"Etherean Info","level":1,"id":"Etherean_Info_0"},{"heading":"AN OBSCURE LINEAGE","level":2,"id":"AN_OBSCURE_LINEAGE_0"},{"heading":"DECENT BY NECESSITY","level":2,"id":"DECENT_BY_NECESSITY_0"},{"heading":"IDEAL TRAVEL COMPANIONS","level":2,"id":"IDEAL_TRAVEL_COMPANIONS_0"},{"heading":"WORLDS TO EXPERIENCE","level":2,"id":"WORLDS_TO_EXPERIENCE_0"},{"heading":"ETHEREAN NAMES","level":2,"id":"ETHEREAN_NAMES_0"},{"heading":"CREATING YOUR ETHEREAN","level":2,"id":"CREATING_YOUR_ETHEREAN_0"},{"heading":"Etherean Features","level":1,"id":"Etherean_Features_0"}],"links":[],"author":"Rasmus","coverImageURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/raceimages/etherean.webp","fullURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/94_character_creation/races/etherean.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":["00_attachments/raceimages/etherean.webp"],"createdTime":1739197766692,"modifiedTime":1765273679217,"sourceSize":14880,"sourcePath":"94_Character_Creation/Races/Etherean.md","exportPath":"94_character_creation/races/etherean.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":293,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"94_character_creation/races/feathren.html":{"title":"Feathren","icon":"","description":"<img alt=\"00_attachments/RaceImages/Feathren.webp\" src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/raceimages/feathren.webp\" target=\"_self\">Reil's talons moved quickly across the surface,tearing through concepts with her charcoal on the paper as easily as flesh. Her piercing eyes darted about the page in search of ideas to explore. Finding none, she moved to a new sheet and put the old one atop the stack to the side.She stared at the now empty parchment in front of her and twirled the stick of charcoal in her hand. Her feathers were ruffled and the rings on her swinging tail clinked softly as they moved back and forth in concentration.The sound of hammers against metal could be heard from the workshop below, resonating with a familiar rhythm and ring hat matched the pace of her thought, charcoal, and tail. She was a pendulum in motion: a clock that counted down to the stroke of brilliance, and when it rang out, the satisfied trills of victory would echo throughout the chamber.\nVyrre Olmeck, The Face of CreationFeathren are the representation of something new from something old. A step beyond their ancestral griffon heri- tage, these bipedal creatures celebrate their individuality amidst the cries and jeers from common folk. Originally bornfrom the Astral Plane, where all things can be lost, found, and remade, feathren now walk the Material Plane in search of new ideas, materials, and direction. Filled with endless curiosity, many make their way through the world as adven- turers and artisans, taking care to learn what they can from their experiences before moving on to the next one.Feathren unite remarkable aspects of two otherwise disparate species. Their strong legs are feline, while their chest, arms, and head are avian. Despite their distant relation to griffons, feathren stand upright and can use their sharp talons to manipulate objects as deftly as any other humanoid. Their voices often bear some bird-like resemblance to their ancestry and contain the occasional trill, coo, or caw.Few feathren look the same. Their fur, plumage, and build can vary widely, forming unique combinations of origin and aptitude. While some feathren are born with the body of an eagle and lion, others combine the likes of owls and crows with tigers and leopards. Feathren find particular pleasure in jewelry and decoration: an inescapable personality trait from their heritage. Without wings to embellish, most turn to adorning themselves with baubles and rings on their talons, feathered ears, and tail. Others enjoy body art, such as tattoos, paints, and other unique means of self expression. Most feathren struggle to resist the urge to preen or adjust their worn finery whenever they catch a glimpse of their reflection.Born with the innate gifts of two naturally skilled creatures, feathren have a shared sense of confidence in their abilities. Feathren spend their lives learning and mastering new trades to sate their curiosity, preferring to answer a puzzle or ques- tion on their own rather than ask for help. Many feathren find camaraderie among those that share a common passion, and while they're remiss to turn to peers for help, they enjoy the sharing of stories and conversation about their interests.As is their nature, feathren enjoy experimenting with names and playing with the combinations they can make with them. Feathren are given a name at birth that's used as a first name, but give themselves new surnames as they grow.Throughout a feathren's lifespan, they may go through as many as twenty surnames: some may last for years, while others are kept for mere weeks. These names are typically combinations of words that describe them and act as either loose titles or personal mantras, and can come from a variety of languages.Male Names: Acero, Astraios, Caicias, Cleve, Fhyriad, Gyrin, Iapet, Ipsideo, Jurat, Klost, Lostro, Quyll, Ronta, Strey, Untreyo, Yulla, ZwayneFemale Names: Accra, Axellia, Coora, Ereya, Finneli, Fuli, Herata, Hyla, Juip, Leies, Lucine, Lustra, Monit, Omi, Parra, Reyda, VelrinExample Surnames: Birthwoven, Crownfeather, Downy, Gemcrest, Ghostwing, Goldtail, Mistwalker, Ricket, Rightedge, Starborn, WavecrushedYour Feathren character has a variety of natural abilities as a result of its unique mix of avian and feline ancestry.Your ability scores increase depending on your Feathren ancestry. Use the Feathren Ancestry tables to determine your combination of physical features and corresponding ability score increases, choosing one Avian option and one Feline option.Young feathren are born from eggs and mature more quickly than humans do, reaching maturity by age 8 and typically living to be around 70.Feathren can be mercurial and admire variety and expression, and as a result tend to lean towards the gentler aspects of chaos. They are more often good than not, although some allow their vanity to turn to greed and evil.Feathren typically range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall with a range of builds based on their ancestry, usually weighing between 100 and 200 pounds. Your size is Medium.Your base walking speed is 30 feet.Your mix of predatory blood has given you eyes that can cut through darkness. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.You have proficiency in two artisan's tools of your choice, and can gain proficiency in a new tool in half the normal amount of time.Your talons are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal slashing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.Due to your curious lineage stemming from the Astral Plane, you have a limited ability to magically harness the stardust that exists within all things. You can cast identify and enhance ability with this trait, without requiring material components. Once you cast either spell, you can't cast that spell again with this trait until you finish a long rest.You have the ability to communicate in a limited manner with cats and birds that are Large or smaller, including griffons. They can understand the meaning of your words, though you have no special ability to understand them in return. You have advantage on all Charisma checks you make to influence them. You can speak, read, and write Common and one extra language of your choice. When choosing a language to study, feathren tend to value the sounds they make more highly than their practicality.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#race"],"headers":[{"heading":"Feathren","level":1,"id":"Feathren_1"},{"heading":"Feathren Info","level":2,"id":"Feathren_Info_0"},{"heading":"Varied Heritage","level":2,"id":"Varied_Heritage_0"},{"heading":"Confident and Curious","level":2,"id":"Confident_and_Curious_0"},{"heading":"Feathren Names","level":2,"id":"Feathren_Names_0"},{"heading":"Feathren Traits","level":1,"id":"Feathren_Traits_0"},{"heading":"Ability Score Increase","level":2,"id":"Ability_Score_Increase_0"},{"heading":"Avian Feathren Ancestry","level":3,"id":"Avian_Feathren_Ancestry_0"},{"heading":"Feline Feathren Ancestry","level":3,"id":"Feline_Feathren_Ancestry_0"},{"heading":"Age","level":2,"id":"Age_0"},{"heading":"Alignment","level":2,"id":"Alignment_0"},{"heading":"Size","level":2,"id":"Size_0"},{"heading":"Speed","level":2,"id":"Speed_0"},{"heading":"Darkvision","level":2,"id":"Darkvision_0"},{"heading":"Natural Creator","level":2,"id":"Natural_Creator_0"},{"heading":"Talons","level":2,"id":"Talons_0"},{"heading":"Astral Ancestry","level":2,"id":"Astral_Ancestry_0"},{"heading":"Kindred Speech","level":2,"id":"Kindred_Speech_0"},{"heading":"Languages","level":2,"id":"Languages_0"}],"links":[],"author":"Rasmus","coverImageURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/raceimages/feathren.webp","fullURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/94_character_creation/races/feathren.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":["00_attachments/raceimages/feathren.webp"],"createdTime":1739197103814,"modifiedTime":1765273681281,"sourceSize":7932,"sourcePath":"94_Character_Creation/Races/Feathren.md","exportPath":"94_character_creation/races/feathren.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":294,"backlinks":["01_pcs/singwin-mistwalker-folder/while-playing/character-sheet.html"],"type":"markdown"},"94_character_creation/races/fuyōren.html":{"title":"Fuyōren","icon":"","description":"<img alt=\"Fuyōren.webp\" src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/raceimages/fuyōren.webp\" target=\"_self\">Born and nurtured on gentle flowing rivers and tranquil ponds, the fuyōren are sentient, mobile plants innately harmonious with the natural world. Fuyōren societies nestle within ecosystems effortlessly, acting in synchronicity with the ebb and flow of the world around them. A society might exist on the same plot of land for millennia, yet remain undetectable to outsiders who pass through, with nary a tree uprooted or stone upturned to indicate the fuyōren’s presence.Bound to nature, the fuyōren bear an imprint of the world at the time of their birth. So-called “winter warriors” are fuyōren born in the bitter, colder months, and are believed to bear an aggressive, steely disposition. Fuyōren born in spring are blessed with a childlike, optimistic disposition, while summer fuyōren are typically charismatic, and autumnal fuyōren are said to be wise. Whether these stereotypes are true or merely a product of a cultural myth manifesting itself in the way fuyōren are raised is unknown.\"Even in tales of triumph, her stories left me with an aching melancholy—a yearning for meadows, lakes, and young grass trembling in a spring breeze.

Many fuyōren cultural traditions include dances, festivals, and ceremonies which aim to placate such behemoths. Bolder fuyōren may actively seek rampaging kaiju, drawing them away from societies and fragile ecosystems and into the untamed wilderness, usually at the cost of their own lives. Bakuryō and other kaiju that do not interfere with the natural world are revered by the fuyōren, while Raiko and other chaotic beings of wanton destructive force are hated and feared.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#race"],"headers":[{"heading":"Fuyōren Info","level":1,"id":"Fuyōren_Info_0"},{"heading":"Seasonal Divination","level":2,"id":"Seasonal_Divination_0"},{"heading":"Kaiju Callers","level":2,"id":"Kaiju_Callers_0"},{"heading":"Fuyōren Traits","level":1,"id":"Fuyōren_Traits_0"}],"links":[],"author":"Rasmus","coverImageURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/raceimages/fuyōren.webp","fullURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/94_character_creation/races/fuyōren.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":["00_attachments/raceimages/fuyōren.webp"],"createdTime":1752937176558,"modifiedTime":1765273683361,"sourceSize":4404,"sourcePath":"94_Character_Creation/Races/Fuyōren.md","exportPath":"94_character_creation/races/fuyōren.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":295,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"94_character_creation/races/geleton.html":{"title":"Geleton","icon":"","description":"<img alt=\"Geleton.webp\" src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/raceimages/geleton.webp\" target=\"_self\">The dark of the ruin was comforting, despite the occasional creaks and distant howls. It was, after all, the only home they’d ever known.\nSitting next to them on the stone floor lay the remnants of long-disused weaponry and rusted chainmail. A little book, long since faded and mildewed, was clutched in their translucent hands. They didn’t know what it used to say, only that it felt like it mattered. The leather binding was both curious and familiar, much like the strewn equipment beside them. A pair of letters, J and S, were sewn into the armor’s cracking leather.\nAnd so, Jayess was the name they’d given to themselves. Whether the armor was theirs or not was a mystery, but it was nice to have an identity to cling to. Of course, it didn’t seem like anyone else was around for them to tell, but in case they came across someone on one of the slow and quiet foraging trips they took, it would be nice to brandish “Jayess” like a badge of honor.\nFor now, the only thing that mattered was sitting still, resting, and staying safe. Terrible, hungering things crept in the shadows outside, and this life grew more and more precious to them with each passing day.\nSo until they needed to move again, it was best to enjoy the comforts of home and hold their book. The faded echoes of lost memories touched Jayess’ mind as they caressed the book’s cover, and as they thought of everything its pages might have once said, they began to imagine the future that they could write in it instead.Geletons are the living, symbiotic fusion of two semi-conscious life forms: oozes and reanimated skeletons. When a skeleton suspended in an ooze is subjected to necromancy that would normally transform it into a mindless thrall, it’s possible for the ooze to magically connect to the reanimated body, and its departed life, instead. This event is called Synthesis, and it’s through this process that the fragments of life held by ooze and skeleton can come together to form a complete whole. Occasionally called Symblexes for their parallels to other intelligent oozes, geletons are given a rare second chance at life—one that they are as moldable to as their gelatinous forms themselvesAt the start of their new lives, geletons are featureless, ooze-covered humanoids with only a spark of traditional consciousness. Over time, usually about a month, this small consciousness grows into a fully sentient being just like any other. During this period, a geleton’s appearance also becomes more discernable, and eventually grows into a humanoid form that feels natural to its budding sense of self. The memories from any of their previous lives are lost in this process, but can resurface in pieces through hazy dreams or waves of déjà vu. Without a unified culture or history, each geleton’s story is unique. Many geletons adopt attitudes similar to those close to them early on in their lives, but others develop strong personalities entirely on their own.By their very nature, almost all geletons come to life in dangerous places. For however many there are in the world, there are countless more that inevitably perished shortly after their creation. Some unscrupulous figures—typically necromancers or mad scientists—try to use the process of Synthesis for personal gain, but are for the most part stopped whenever they’re discovered. Geletons created and held captive in such harrowing conditions for a long time often carry a deep-seated fear or resentment for necromancy, if not all magic, for the remainder of their lives. Other geletons created in such conditions recover faster, especially if they are found and rescued shortly after their Synthesis. Regardless, the origins of virtually all geletons are rife with danger, and those that are brought into safety early in their lives are counted among the most lucky.By far, gelatinous cubes are the most common subject of Synthesis. These clear oozes are known to carry skeletal remains longer than others, and in doing so have a higher chance of becoming a geleton. As a result, most geletons’ bodies are similarly translucent. When other oozes like black puddings or ochre jellies undergo Synthesis, the resulting geleton’s appearance is typically more opaque.\nRegardless of the ooze, a geleton’s form always reflects their desired features. Most eventually resemble humans or elves, but when a dragonborn or tiefling skeleton is used in Synthesis, their appearance will often reflect that ancestry in some capacity. Similarly, all geletons have a viscous sheen to their bodies, and though they may have the appearance of hair or eyes, they are still fully gelatinous in nature.Depending on the nature of your campaign, it’s safe to assume that most common folk have never seen a geleton before. This is rarely an issue in cosmopolitan cities where even the most unusual races are hardly given a second look, but superstitious villagers and rural townsfolk may see a geleton as a creature of mere ooze and bone rather than as a complete person. This can cause friction in some cases, and outright panic in others. Geletons that travel to these places with other creatures, especially those that resemble more common humanoids, can usually avoid any is- sues if at least one of their companions is with them.Geletons tend to choose names that are important to them and are independent of the gender that they eventually choose to assume, if any. These names may be based on items that were nearby when they gained sentience, or could even be based on names they dimly remember. Geletons that are rescued or become part of an adventuring party early in their lives may choose to adopt or modify a name given to them by an ally, rather than create one from scratch.When creating your geleton character, use these traits as a guide, rather than a rule. Geletons are naturally resilient thanks to their ooze heritage, which is reflected in the Ability Score Increase and Symbiotic Fortitude traits, but yours may have different strengths. In this case, increase one ability score of your choice by 2 and another by 1, or choose three different ability scores to increase by 1.\nIf you feel that 5 feet of blindsight is too powerful for your game, consider instead granting your player’s geleton a skill and tool proficiency of their choice. As mentioned in the Ability Score Increase trait, this proficiency could be related to what your geleton did or knew in a previous life.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#race"],"headers":[{"heading":"Geleton Info","level":1,"id":"Geleton_Info_0"},{"heading":"A BRAND NEW LIFE","level":2,"id":"A_BRAND_NEW_LIFE_0"},{"heading":"DANGEROUS BEGINNINGS","level":2,"id":"DANGEROUS_BEGINNINGS_0"},{"heading":"UNUSUAL APPEARANCE","level":2,"id":"UNUSUAL_APPEARANCE_0"},{"heading":"A SUM OF DANGEROUS PARTS","level":2,"id":"A_SUM_OF_DANGEROUS_PARTS_0"},{"heading":"GELETON NAMES","level":2,"id":"GELETON_NAMES_0"},{"heading":"CREATING YOUR GELETON","level":2,"id":"CREATING_YOUR_GELETON_0"},{"heading":"Geleton Features","level":1,"id":"Geleton_Features_0"}],"links":[],"author":"Rasmus","coverImageURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/raceimages/geleton.webp","fullURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/94_character_creation/races/geleton.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":["00_attachments/raceimages/geleton.webp"],"createdTime":1739197766708,"modifiedTime":1765273686160,"sourceSize":11094,"sourcePath":"94_Character_Creation/Races/Geleton.md","exportPath":"94_character_creation/races/geleton.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":296,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"94_character_creation/races/gobboc.html":{"title":"Gobboc","icon":"","description":"<img alt=\"Gobboc.webp\" src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/raceimages/gobboc.webp\" target=\"_self\">Nestled in secluded clearings in the woods, on hilltops with extraordinary vantages, or in easily collapsible canyons, gobbocs (go-BOC) seek safety above all else. Survival is a gobboc’s watchword; their own survival is their number one goal on expedition—treasure, glory, and saving the world be damned.You’ll likely recognise the back of a gobboc’s head more than the front, given their propensity to run away at the first sign of danger. While this is the epitome of cowardice, it is a specifically brave kind of cowardice; life is scary and living another day is the bravest thing you can do. At least, this is what is taught to gobboc from the moment they can walk, a few hours after they’re born.A typical gobboc is never the first to enter a room nor the last in a line of dungeon delvers. They aim to keep bodies firmly before and behind them, a tactical meat shield to ward off harm. Indeed, gobbocs are the ultimate hit-and-run fighters, retreating from a foe before it can retaliate against their precise and lightning-quick attacks. This method of fighting, taught to all gobbocs, is known as the Klucking Fighting Creed.Gobbocs have a peculiar tendency to sit on things. The pinnacle of this innate desire is the Festival of Brooding, sometimes known as the Eggstravaganza. This annual event finds all the gobbocs in a town creating the most comfortable thrones, bean bag chairs, and bundles of straw possible before sitting on them around a huge bonfire. There are no fireworks; sudden, loud noises are frowned upon in gobboc society.Gobbocs worship other birds. The bigger the bird, the more holy it is. In fact, similarly to kobolds, gobboc belief is innately magical. It is so potent that gobboc belief causes birds to become more intelligent. In times of war, gobboc hosts are often accompanied by flocks of birds: razor-clawed and quick-witted cassowaries form cavalry divisions, while flying contingents are composed of super-intelligent hippogriffs. It is widely posited that the famous gobboc playwright Owlfred Hatchcluck based his play, The Birds, on this uniquely gobboc occurrence.<br><img alt=\"Gobboc - Tiny Chicken Statblock.webp\" src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/raceimages/gobboc-tiny-chicken-statblock.webp\" target=\"_self\">","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#race"],"headers":[{"heading":"Gobboc Info","level":1,"id":"Gobboc_Info_0"},{"heading":"Brave Cowards","level":2,"id":"Brave_Cowards_0"},{"heading":"Fit and Sit","level":2,"id":"Fit_and_Sit_0"},{"heading":"Avian Ascendency","level":2,"id":"Avian_Ascendency_0"},{"heading":"Gobboc Features","level":1,"id":"Gobboc_Features_0"}],"links":[],"author":"Rasmus","coverImageURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/raceimages/gobboc.webp","fullURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/94_character_creation/races/gobboc.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":["00_attachments/raceimages/gobboc.webp","00_attachments/raceimages/gobboc-tiny-chicken-statblock.webp"],"createdTime":1739197103802,"modifiedTime":1765273688557,"sourceSize":6718,"sourcePath":"94_Character_Creation/Races/Gobboc.md","exportPath":"94_character_creation/races/gobboc.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":297,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"94_character_creation/races/golynn.html":{"title":"Golynn","icon":"","description":"<img alt=\"Golynn.webp\" src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/raceimages/golynn.webp\" target=\"_self\">The rich scent of freshly-turned earth may be a sure indicator that a group of nomadic golynn (GO-lin) is in the area. Vivacious wanderers, golynn are creatures of nature and have little use for the trappings of modern society. Their shovel-like hands, scaly exterior, and insect-devouring constitution ensure their survival wherever the earth is soft and the soil is fertile.Golynn adore rhythm. They find joy in the thrum of a lightning-rail, the clip-clop of a riding goat’s hooves, and the heartbeats of their kith and kin. From these everyday occurrences, golynn make wonderfully complex polyrhythms, music whose restorative vibrations can reinvigorate the melancholy and afraid. Indeed, the lead percussionist for the legendary opteran band, Wings of a Butterfly, was Hopo Aman, a golynn maestro of the dwarven tablah. Golynn legend tells of a single, pulsing rhythm that drives all life in the world, the golo’apa, or ‘Heartbeat of the World’. Many golynn’s nomadic existence is a singular quest to explore all the nooks and crannies of the world, searching for this rhythm. In their never-ending pilgrimage, golynn leave a plethora of hidden burrows—warm, safe spaces whose locations are passed on by word of mouth.This constant burrowing can sometimes bring golynn into conflict with the uto monké, or ‘those that live under the sky’. Golynn have ruined many a quality murderbowl pitch and have even inadvertently undermined castles while searching for the rhythmic clanking of a prisoner’s chains. Conversely, some farmers, recognising their natural aptitude for digging, engage passing golynn as farmhands whenever possible, promising them all the grubs they can eat in exchange for a day’s work. Not all golynn are raised by their own kin. Rumours of the magical healing properties of golynn scales still abound, leading unsavoury and desperate individuals to hunt them for these entirely-mundane components. Fortunately, orphaned golynn have been taken in by all manner of parents, from halflings, dwarves, and gnomes to lotol and kobolds, who regard them as huge, scaled, dragon-kin. With their fondness for exploration, golynn make natural adventurers. A burrowing golynn might accidentally fall into an underground sepulchre, find a long-buried artifact, or stumble upon the machinations of an evil necromancer bent on raising an army of the undead.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#race"],"headers":[{"heading":"Golynn Info","level":1,"id":"Golynn_Info_0"},{"heading":"Hearth and Heartbeat","level":2,"id":"Hearth_and_Heartbeat_0"},{"heading":"Dig a Hole Lotta’ Trouble","level":2,"id":"Dig_a_Hole_Lotta’_Trouble_0"},{"heading":"Happenstance","level":2,"id":"Happenstance_0"},{"heading":"Golynn Features","level":1,"id":"Golynn_Features_0"}],"links":[],"author":"Rasmus","coverImageURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/raceimages/golynn.webp","fullURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/94_character_creation/races/golynn.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":["00_attachments/raceimages/golynn.webp"],"createdTime":1739197103815,"modifiedTime":1765273691141,"sourceSize":7685,"sourcePath":"94_Character_Creation/Races/Golynn.md","exportPath":"94_character_creation/races/golynn.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":298,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"94_character_creation/races/hanamori.html":{"title":"Hanamori","icon":"","description":"<img alt=\"Hanamori.webp\" src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/raceimages/hanamori.webp\" target=\"_self\">With gaunt faces, charcoal skin, and coarse crimson petals, hanamori are a race of sentient plants believed by many to be harbingers of death. This reputation is not wholly unfounded, for hanamori are physiologically sympathetic; their bodies reverberate in harmony with the fleeting spirit of creatures that die in their presence, taking on traits of the deceased for a short time. The slaughter of a mighty beast is felt by its hunters as a surge of physical Strength, and the passing of a sage as a transcendent moment of heightened Wisdom. As a result, hanamori have a complex relationship with death; to die in their presence is to pass a glimpse of oneself to another, for a short time.\nReactive Physiology\nA hanamori’s sympathetic physiology extends to the world around them. While they can briefly share in the physiology of creatures who die, they can permanently take on the physical characteristics of their environment over a longer duration. Humid jungles might impart a hanamori with a permanent scent of rich flora, while icy mountains cause their body to forever be chill to the touch. Hanamori adventurers who travel the world end their lives as a collage of the habitats that succored them, a jigsaw infused with environmental memories ever bonded to their form.\nBurning Emotions\nHanamori are naturally passionate and active. They think, speak, and adapt swiftly, and are known for their fiery tempers and zealous loyalty. With short lives, hanamori see little value in holding grudges or overanalysing a situation, preferring to think on their feet and revel in the heat of each moment. A hanamori’s emotional state can be read on its body: its petals blush darkly when enraged, and the tips of its branches sprout new buds during periods of prolonged grief.

As the centuries waned, the haniwa spirits were thought to have passed from the world, leaving their clay shells behind, empty vessels standing in the cool darkness of forgotten tombs. However, the magic of the haniwa endured. Long dormant, the haniwa began to reawaken over the last century, emerging into a new world after being displaced by millennia from their origin. Most haniwa, newly reborn, have no memory of their former selves or original task, their hallowed grounds long since plundered or buried beneath the soil of an ever shifting realm. As such, haniwa often become wanderers, seeking purpose and fortune in an alien world. It isn’t uncommon to see haniwa find purpose through devotion to a cause, practice, or order, often working as clerics, paladins, and monks. The few haniwa that retain some memory of their past life now find themselves serving a grander purpose than protector of a tomb; they are guardians to the memory of a world no one else remembers.

A race of large, crustacean-like Humanoids, isetsu have made a home facing the ocean for millennia, thriving and hunting beneath the open waves, and resting on the shore. Although they do not swim as nimbly as nishikin or ryūjin, the isetsu’s superior eyesight, towering bodies, and resolute carapaces serve them well in the deep; they are the undisputed rulers of the cliffs and seabeds.It is said that at the dawn of the world, isetsu were tasked with the defence of the land against the roiling sea. All manner of horrors dwell in the black void of the ocean depths, and core to the isetsu way of life is the shared, endless responsibility to stand watch on the shore. All isetsu train in combat, and all feel an aching longing to face the ocean. Even isetsu that travel the world, shirking their divine responsibility, feel this pull, and the reverberation of an isetsu’s heartbeat through its carapace mimics the gentle lapping of waves on the shore—a whisper to return home. This is the isetsu’s burden: to be in love with the ocean, yet tasked to defend against it. They are the first line of defence against any threat that rises from the sea, be it pirate, typhoon, or kaiju.Isetsu hold a deterministic philosophy: just as their destiny was set at the dawn of the world, so are others beating an inevitable path, whether they realise it or not. To the isetsu, luck is a complex, measurable science, and good fortune is a talent that can be trained, a skill they dedicate endless hours to mastering. Many tales of incredible, serendipitous events occurring in favour of the isetsu seem to indicate this training holds worth. Even the most sceptical members of other races begrudgingly accept that the isetsu come up “lucky” in battle at a rate far beyond any other creature.

The kitsune’s powers of transformation are legendary, being able to assume a fox’s form in a fashion similar to a druid’s mastery of Wild Shape. Even in their humanoid body, kitsune retain the tail, ears, and clawed feet of their canine cousins, along with a fox’s nimble gait and inquisitive mind. As comfortable in humanoid form as they are as a fox, it is only for the love of interacting with other folk that so many kitsune live their lives almost entirely in their true, bipedal shape, finding it easier to integrate into communities and explore the world in this way.Kitsune communication incorporates nonverbal cues innate to beasts and other beings of the natural world. A swish of the tail or a tilt of the head carries great significance; a subtle gesture can be the difference between playful jibe and deadly threat. Kitsune grow an additional tail for each century they live, and so they complain more and more frequently of the blundering unsophistication of purely verbal languages; each swirling tail adds a subtle layer of meaning, granting elders the power to express that which is inexpressible to those limited by the spoken word.Long lives, innate curiosity, and a restless drive to understand others lead ancient kitsune to be revered for their wisdom and knowledge. Many act as wandering counsellors and justicars, drawing on a millennium of experience to right the wrongs of the world according to their own perspective. Others focus on a particular branch of research, gaining and spreading knowledge as they travel, or plying their trade as merchants.

In their own tongue, lotol are known as the ‘lizards without scales’.Consequently, lotol often remark when they meet humanoids that do have scales, such as dragonborn, lizardfolk, or golynn This reaction varies, from awe to envy, or from open infatuation to a fearful expectation of insensitivity or brutishness (stereotypes some lotol individuals hold). A sect of lotol, The Platinum Apology, dedicate their lives to ending this curse and restoring themselves as scale-wearing reptiles Whether or not this curse is real, let alone possible, is unknownThe few times lotol ever come into conflict with neighbours, it is almost always to do with water A growing lotol population creates new wetlands by damming up rivers, sometimes to the chagrin of local trappers and woodsfolk. Following floods, whole pods of lotol can find themselves washed downstream into an entirely new (and often recently-drowned) habitat. Fortunately for those that may be reconstructing their lives following such an inundation, lotol are more than keen to help Lotol with innate aqueous adaptations can prove a blessing to washed-out villages and offset the enmity villagers may feel towards this newly-arrived population of semi-nomadic salamander-folk 160 Chaouki “Ciao” Titouhi &amp; Jesse Jackdaw Burns; Opposite: Jesse Jackdaw BurnsWith their supple, permeable skin, lotol are extremely sensitive to pollutants If a black dragon poisons the water upstream or heavy metals from a dwarven mine begin to leech into the groundwater, lotol are often the first to know.

Nothing is waste; rotten food can fatten a pig, a ruined shirt is a bandage waiting to happen, and corpses are new homes in need of a little bit of reinvigoration Marginalised and persecuted by most societies, mycelians’ propensity to recycle the recently deceased often brings them into conflict with other humanoids. That being said, graverobbers and less scrupulous grey market traders have been known to make a pretty penny out of selling ageing mycelians their next vessels.Mycelians reanimate the bodies of the recently deceased. Understandably, many more ‘civilised’ races disagree with this practice—it’s difficult to meet your uncle again a few hours after interring him Moreover, mycelians don’t have the same regenerative abilities as the body’s original inhabitant; wounds are patched over with a web of hyphae, the skin takes on a pale pallor, and the body wears out fairly quickly, lasting six to seven years.Much like hermit crabs wear shells, mycelians inoculate corpses with microscopic spores, before growing a web of hyphae through the body. Nerves are co-opted, muscles are repaired, and fungal organs replace the internal viscera of the host The process is entirely biological, but less tolerant denizens of the world often believe these reanimated bodies to be the work of necromancers, treating mycelians as infectious, living dead.The key to distinguishing a mycelian from a zombie, of course, is the smell Mycelians carry a hearty, musky aroma like that of a vivacious forest floor. Undead, on the other hand, carry the putrid-sweet scent of decay. After several unfortunate interactions with necromancer-hunters, the Sisters of Mercy began employing dogs, with their keen sense of smell, to help differentiate between innocent mycelians and undead artifice.With each new host, a mycelian’s psyche changes a little, moulded by the brain, body, and abilities of the host it co-opts In moving from one host to another, a mycelian also leaves behind some of its own memories, forever lost to the decay of time. Despite being potentially thousands of years old, the longest-living communities of mycelians often have memories stretching back only a few decades. For this reason, mycelians conduct a ritual shortly before death, where they recant a rhythmic history of their exploits in this host, adding it to the oral history of their community. These oral histories can be days long, and minor word changes (or ‘linguistic decay’ as scholars refer to it) have resulted in tales becoming more and more outlandish the further back in time they occurredEvery mycelian oral history has one thing in common: its beginning. These stories all start with the ‘Mothershroom’, a behemoth fungal organism and progenitor to all mycelians. In some stories, the Mothershroom takes the form of a giant, multi-coloured tree. In others, it is a miles-wide web of interconnecting, pulsing hyphae that thrum with thought and feeling. Despite their best efforts, no mycelian, explorer, or scholar has ever found the Mothershroom. Any knowledge of its location—if it even exists—has been lost to the grinding wheel of time.Many mycelians have embarked on quests to find their ancient ancestor. For some such adventurers, the desire to find this holy figure is the only memory they retain between bodies.\nDamage Resistance (Multiple).

You can move through the space of any creature that is of a size larger than yours.\nMuscle Memory (Any). You gain proficiency in one skill of your choice. You can take this option multiple times.\nNatural Weapon (Multiple). You have a physical characteristic, such as horns, claws, or teeth, that acts as a natural melee weapon which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with it, you deal bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage (depending on the body part) equal to your Strength modifier plus a damage die determined by your host body’s race, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.\nPowerful Build (Multiple).

These fading, lost souls begin to manifest monstrous forms, although some especially resilient individuals manage to pull themselves from this dark path before their essence is wiped clean. Known as ombrasks (OM-brask), these translucent creatures hail from a variety of heritages; from elf to dwarf, dragonborn to lotol, and rakin to goblin All struggle to recall even the simplest memory, such as their former name, and all have a ghostly, colourless appearance.One of the first things an ombrask forgets is its voice. Though it knows and can understand the meaning of words, its cadence, pitch, and patterns of speech fade from lack of use; the dreary, joyless experience of the Shadow Plane leaves little to talk about. However, ombrasks become especially sensitive to the psychic burst of emotion that accompanies death, the freeing of a soul from its shadow-numbed body. Ombrasks can latch onto the shreds of this psyche and adopt its speech patterns, learning to mimic them perfectly.Next lost is the ability to feel, love, and smile; any emotion associated with joy or excitement is nullified. With prolonged distance from the Shadow Plane, or exposure to realms of strong emotion, such as the Plane of Fey or Springarden, these sensations can make a slow return for a lucky few. What is never lost is the memory of mundane tasks, such as ploughing, chopping wood, or polishing armour. Muscle memory is scarred into the minds of ombrasks, making them particularly deft at tiny, detailed work.If an ombrask doesn’t find a way to exit the Shadow Plane or isn’t summoned by some novice wizard, it can fade entirely, becoming an invisible, skulking creature bent only on survival. In fact, there is strong evidence to suggest that the creature summoned by the unseen servant spell is one of these invisible creatures, temporarily pulled from the Shadow Plane. The fate of those too far gone is enough to stop most explorers from staying long in that dull and lifeless expanse.A sense of adventure, a magical mishap, or a cruel curse, there are a multitude of reasons why a native of the Material Plane might find itself shunned to the Shadow Plane. Discovering who they used to be is a motivator for many ombrasks. Do they have parents? Cultural traditions? What is their history? On the other hand, some ombrasks, perhaps those with a foreboding sense of their past misdeeds, choose to ignore what might have come before and focus on living life anew.

An oniborne’s retort may physically scold the body of a foe, flesh might reknit under their palms in moments of compassion, or they may physically shrink when gripped with terror.The life of an oniborne is one plagued by fear and suspicion. Being descendants of the oni, grotesque and dangerous yokai, many other Humanoids view oniborne as savage, ugly, violent, and cruel—more akin to demons than their Fey ancestors. These are ancient stereotypes, passed from parent to child in bedtime tales of terror. All oniborne, be they virtuous or villainous, suffer under this crude prejudice.Oniborne reverberate with magic in a way unlike any other race. In the legendary words of Khal Oni: “We simply feel more”. Be it the blood rage of warfare or the serene tranquility of meditation, oniborne revel in the full gamut of life’s experiences.

The most sociable of the three oniborne heritages, many red oniborne journey the world sharing time-worn tales of adventure while forging their own.On the cusp of adulthood, red oniborne leave their troop to undertake the Rite of the Hunt. They venture into the wilderness armed with nothing more than their wits in a quest to slay a dangerous foe and craft a weapon from its body. The rite remains an essential foundation of red oniborne culture across their lives. The more deadly the prey, the greater the respect an oniborne gains. It is not uncommon to see troop elders proudly clad in pelts and wielding weapons hewn from the remains of chromatic dragons and other vanquished terrors.The magic of the blue oniborne is subtle and primal, a singing river of energy that ripples through the body. It can be relayed through physical contact, a healing stream imparted by a gentle touch, or a crushing wave that surges through their biting jaws.Solitary by nature, most blue oniborne choose to remain with the troop across their lives, a peaceful existence of isolation and independence. The few blue oniborne blessed with an adventurous spirit are unlikely to find kin in the wider world. They must journey without the guidance of their troop, every path an unmapped wilderness.Preferring warm, arid climates, green oniborne are typically a nomadic people. They chase the gentle warmth of an eternal summer, ever migrating as they wander between orchards, pastures, and oases on a time-worn path passed down across the generations.Widely renowned as great orators, green oniborne speak in hammering rhythm, a staccato avalanche of stories, ideas, and possibilities. Their spellcasting is equally animated; green oniborne are the most overtly magical among their cousins.

An oozekin that develops in the former lair of\na red dragon might take on its avaricious and arrogant personality traits, while one that forms\nnear a sleeping adventurer might be filled with wanderlust and risk-taking qualities. Indeed,\nthe grey matter that a biomantic ooze consumes can have a significant influence on the subse-\nquent oozekin’s values, habits, and memories. Tales abound of oozey doppelgangers, facsimi-\nles of fallen adventurers that believe themselves to be the deceased creature reborn.If a player character dies in an area rich with biomancy, you can consider allowing their character to be reborn as an oozekin. A biomantic ooze may well consume the grey matter of their brain and adopt a plethora of their personality traits, memories, and class levels.Relatively new to the world, oozekin are keen to prove themselves the equal of any other race.\nThough most oozekin exist within the framework of other, established civilisations, pods of oozekin\nsettlements have arisen in corners of The Low. These conglomerations mix the various assimilated\ncultures and traditions each oozekin has experienced or formed with, often with unpredictable\nconsequences. Luckily, oozekin’s propensity to get along with one another has resulted in the reconciliation of schisms between historically antagonistic races, such as grey dwarves and dark elves, even if only vicariously through their oozekin adoptees. Most oozekin are more than happy to fulfill their role as helpful and productive citizens, contributing to society in any way they can. Others, perhaps those that accidentally harmed friends with their acidic skin, go to obscene lengths to disguise their true form, covering themselves head to toe in scraps of clothing,\nnever staying in one place too long. An especially curious and introspective few live to discover the reason for their existence. How come they have no parents? Where is their history? Why do they exist?Your walking speed is halved and your body becomes a 5-foot cube. You can safely store any items you are carrying, holding, or wearing in a vesicle within your body. Creatures directly behind you have three-quarters cover against attacks that originate on the opposite side of you. You also gain a new action option, the Engulf action:You move up to your speed and can attempt to move into the space of one creature of equal or smaller size than you, which must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your Strength modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failure, if you aren’t already grappling a creature, the creature becomes grappled by you. While grappled in this way, the creature is restrained and takes acid damage at the start of each of its turns as if it had failed a saving throw against your acid splash cantrip. On a success, you expend the movement but remain in the space from which your movement originated. Your walking speed is halved as you collapse into a 5-foot-diameter pool. You can’t hold or carry items and any objects you are holding, carrying, or wearing when you transform fall to the ground in your space. While in this form, attack rolls by creatures further than 5 feet away from you have disadvantage to hit you, you non-magically gain the benefits of the spider climb spell, and you can travel through spaces as small as 1 inch wide without squeezing.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#race"],"headers":[{"heading":"Oozekin Info","level":1,"id":"Oozekin_Info_0"},{"heading":"Biomantic Origins","level":2,"id":"Biomantic_Origins_0"},{"heading":"Oozey Re-birth","level":2,"id":"Oozey_Re-birth_0"},{"heading":"Willing and Able","level":2,"id":"Willing_and_Able_0"},{"heading":"Oozekin Features","level":1,"id":"Oozekin_Features_0"},{"heading":"Reshapeable effects:","level":2,"id":"Reshapeable_effects_0"},{"heading":"Cube Form","level":3,"id":"Cube_Form_0"},{"heading":"Engulf","level":4,"id":"Engulf_0"},{"heading":"Puddle Form","level":3,"id":"Puddle_Form_0"}],"links":[],"author":"Rasmus","coverImageURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/raceimages/oozekin.webp","fullURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/94_character_creation/races/oozekin.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":["00_attachments/raceimages/oozekin.webp"],"createdTime":1739196659176,"modifiedTime":1765273729197,"sourceSize":9834,"sourcePath":"94_Character_Creation/Races/Oozekin.md","exportPath":"94_character_creation/races/oozekin.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":307,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"94_character_creation/races/opteran.html":{"title":"Opteran","icon":"","description":"<img class=\"w-full h-full object-cover object-center\" src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/raceimages/opteran-larvae.webp\" alt=\"Opteran Larvae\" target=\"_self\"> Opteran Larvae<img class=\"w-full h-full object-cover object-center\" src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/raceimages/opteran.webp\" alt=\"Opteran\" target=\"_self\"> Opteran A sedentary life among the birds and insects of their treetop dwellings is the most adventurous goal of many opterans’ lives. In shades of green and brown, these larval opterans (OP-ter-an) are happy to avoid conflict, camouflaging into the canopy from which they acquire sustenance. But, with a brilliant flash of colour, an adult opteran injects this placid scene with a vivacious zest for life. Frantic flaps of its broad, multicoloured wings usher this metamorphosed form to and fro, a sparkling rainbow that nary takes a moment to rest.Opterans can, in theory, live forever. So long as they are never stressed (and have no goals for reproduction), a larval opteran doesn’t age and can enjoy an indefinite life of sedentary bliss. However, should the need arise, such as during times of environmental catastrophe, war, or fits of passion, a larval opteran enters a chrysalis in which it metamorphoses into its winged, adult form. Once it emerges, the clock begins ticking; it lives no more than 2 or 3 years in this form, just long enough to find a mate and produce a new batch of larvae elsewhere in the world. Because of this, larval opterans are extremely conflict-averse. If a predator comes a-calling, a larval opteran prefers to deploy its sticky ‘string shot’ and retreat to the safety of its tree-home, rather than potentially become overstimulated. Conversely, adult, winged opterans often lose this sense\nof self-preservation, a behaviour change that the uneducated might describe as ‘disturbing’. Due to their brilliant colouration and short lives, opterans make some of the most renowned performers. Tales are told of the bard group Wings of a Butterfly’s first and final world tour. So in-demand were tickets to this once-in-their-lifetime show, that monarchs even traded small earldoms in order to purchase a show for their courts. Opterans that choose to venture into the wider world are often old, tired of the sedentary life, and ready for adventure. However, the de-\nstruction of an opteran’s home, the search for a loved one, or the desire to be the next Wings of a Butterfly could all be worthy motivators to risk undergoing the change.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#race"],"headers":[{"heading":"Opteran Info","level":1,"id":"Opteran_Info_0"},{"heading":"Live Fast, Die Young","level":2,"id":"Live_Fast,_Die_Young_0"},{"heading":"Natural Performers","level":2,"id":"Natural_Performers_0"},{"heading":"Opteran Features","level":1,"id":"Opteran_Features_0"}],"links":[],"author":"Rasmus","coverImageURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se","fullURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/94_character_creation/races/opteran.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":["00_attachments/raceimages/opteran-larvae.webp","00_attachments/raceimages/opteran.webp"],"createdTime":1739196659188,"modifiedTime":1765273732401,"sourceSize":10641,"sourcePath":"94_Character_Creation/Races/Opteran.md","exportPath":"94_character_creation/races/opteran.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":308,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"94_character_creation/races/races.html":{"title":"Races","icon":"","description":"","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":["94_character_creation/races/cappy.html","94_character_creation/races/cnidaran.html","94_character_creation/races/cyclopian.html","94_character_creation/races/enkoh.html","94_character_creation/races/etherean.html","94_character_creation/races/feathren.html","94_character_creation/races/fuyōren.html","94_character_creation/races/geleton.html","94_character_creation/races/gobboc.html","94_character_creation/races/golynn.html","94_character_creation/races/hanamori.html","94_character_creation/races/haniwa.html","94_character_creation/races/isetsu.html","94_character_creation/races/kitsune.html","94_character_creation/races/lotol.html","94_character_creation/races/mycelian.html","94_character_creation/races/ombrask.html","94_character_creation/races/oniborne.html","94_character_creation/races/oozekin.html","94_character_creation/races/opteran.html","94_character_creation/races/rakin.html","94_character_creation/races/ryokido.html","94_character_creation/races/tatsumi.html","94_character_creation/races/tengu.html"],"author":"Rasmus","coverImageURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se","fullURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/94_character_creation/races/races.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":["00_attachments/raceimages/cappy-paladin.webp","00_attachments/raceimages/cnidaran.webp","00_attachments/raceimages/cyclopian.webp","00_attachments/raceimages/enkoh.webp","00_attachments/raceimages/etherean.webp","00_attachments/raceimages/feathren.webp","00_attachments/raceimages/fuyōren.webp","00_attachments/raceimages/geleton.webp","00_attachments/raceimages/gobboc.webp","00_attachments/raceimages/golynn.webp","00_attachments/raceimages/hanamori.webp","00_attachments/raceimages/haniwa2.webp","00_attachments/raceimages/isetsu.webp","00_attachments/raceimages/kitsune.webp","00_attachments/raceimages/lotol.webp","00_attachments/raceimages/mycelial.webp","00_attachments/raceimages/ombrask.webp","00_attachments/raceimages/oniborne.webp","00_attachments/raceimages/oozekin.webp","00_attachments/raceimages/opteran-larvae.webp","00_attachments/raceimages/rakin.webp","00_attachments/raceimages/ryokido.webp","00_attachments/raceimages/tatsumi.webp","00_attachments/raceimages/hanataka-tengu.webp"],"createdTime":1739197766706,"modifiedTime":1761556896152,"sourceSize":416,"sourcePath":"94_Character_Creation/Races/Races.md","exportPath":"94_character_creation/races/races.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":309,"backlinks":["index.html"],"type":"markdown"},"94_character_creation/races/rakin.html":{"title":"Rakin","icon":"","description":"<img alt=\"Rakin.webp\" src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/raceimages/rakin.webp\" target=\"_self\">Yells and chuckles are common sounds around the home of any rakin (RACK-in) thanks to their\nshared love language: pranks. From sewer-side burrows to palatial penthouses, wattle-and-daub\nhuts to intricate treetop villages, rakin can be found at all levels of society, a product of their ingeniousness and habit of getting into trouble. One is rarely bored around a rakin.The mistaken spawn of a passionate tryst between deities of trickery and nature, rakin hold a deep affinity for both domains. Since their creation, they have had little contact with either god, learning to rely on their own wits to survive.\nTrickery. As rakin society progressed, their culture grew to value trickery and subterfuge.Good-natured pranks sprang from their paws as instinctively as breathing. Honed against the\nfearsome beasts of the forest, this innate talent to deceive helped the rakin bloom as a civilisation.\nTales are still told of how Mack Gyver fought off a rampaging owlboar with nought but a goodberry, a silver needle, and a pig’s bladder.Pranks. Rakin politics, religion, and interpersonal relationships revolve around the idea of practical jokes. An atmosphere of one-up-manship and lighthearted merriment suffuses all of their wheelings and dealings. Even when faced with the most horrid of circumstances, a rakin’s first instinct is to crack a joke.After centuries of living in chaotic mirth, an ideological battle split rakin culture in two when they\nfirst made contact with other humanoids. Many of the rakin were intrigued by cities—forests of stone and steel; organized, yet unpredictable, and full of opportunity. The elders forbade them to interact, alleging such civilization to be directly counter to the chaos that nature intended, the principle upon which rakin culture was built.The debacle spiralled into a full-on feud between the opposing rakin factions, sundering the once\nunited race. The urkin broke with tradition and followed their ambition into the cities, whilst the\ntanukin remained in their indigenous forests, adhering to their ancestral ways.<br><img alt=\"Rakin Urkin.webp\" src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/raceimages/rakin-urkin.webp\" target=\"_self\">\nUrkin society values cunning, savvy, and—above all—the thrill of the heist. This leaves the urkin with a bit of a nasty reputation, a fact that utterly fails to curb their ambitions. Adaptable and resourceful, urkin excel as confidence tricksters and pickpockets.<br><img alt=\"Rakin Posskin.webp\" src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/raceimages/rakin-posskin.webp\" target=\"_self\">\nWhile the tanukin and urkin found homes in forests and cities, a third, smaller contingent embraced their wanderlust and a life of vagabondry. With the road as their home, posskin never settle in one place for long and are well adapted to the harsh conditions associated with constantly sleeping outdoors.\nTheir ability to withstand disease enables them to act as scavengers, feasting on the left-to-rot remains of other carnivores. Should they ever find themselves the target of a territorial creature, their innate ability to play dead can often trick such aggressors into believing they are no longer a threat and leaving them alone, if a little bloodied.Posskin might find employ in a variety of walks of life. From hedge knights to circus performers,\ntravelling snake oil salesmen to chronic dumpster divers, so long as the job keeps moving, a posskin stays happy.<br><img alt=\"Rakin Tanukin.webp\" src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/raceimages/rakin-tanukin.webp\" target=\"_self\">\nTanukin believe that civilization is a sacrilegious destruction of the beautiful chaos of nature. So rarely do tanukin venture into humanoid settlements that they are often mistaken for racoons, or worse, urkin. The times they do deign to enter the ‘stone forests’, it is to use their illusion magic to evoke the divine chaos and confusion that they associate with the natural world.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#race"],"headers":[{"heading":"Rakin Info","level":1,"id":"Rakin_Info_0"},{"heading":"Deific Origins","level":2,"id":"Deific_Origins_0"},{"heading":"Ideological Chasm","level":2,"id":"Ideological_Chasm_0"},{"heading":"Rakin Features","level":1,"id":"Rakin_Features_0"},{"heading":"Subraces","level":2,"id":"Subraces_0"},{"heading":"Urkin","level":3,"id":"Urkin_0"},{"heading":"Posskin","level":3,"id":"Posskin_0"},{"heading":"Tanukin","level":3,"id":"Tanukin_0"}],"links":[],"author":"Rasmus","coverImageURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/raceimages/rakin.webp","fullURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/94_character_creation/races/rakin.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":["00_attachments/raceimages/rakin.webp","00_attachments/raceimages/rakin-urkin.webp","00_attachments/raceimages/rakin-posskin.webp","00_attachments/raceimages/rakin-tanukin.webp"],"createdTime":1739196622190,"modifiedTime":1765273740618,"sourceSize":16495,"sourcePath":"94_Character_Creation/Races/Rakin.md","exportPath":"94_character_creation/races/rakin.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":310,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"94_character_creation/races/ryokido.html":{"title":"Ryokido","icon":"","description":"<img alt=\"Ryokido.webp\" src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/raceimages/ryokido.webp\" target=\"_self\">Nestled deep within wizened, dry thorn forests, the most ancient settlements in the realm persist, unbroken by scouring winds, blistering sun, or the relentless march of time. Here live the ryokido, colloquially known as “lion turtles”, a race of telepathic beings that call this inhospitable expanse home. All ryokido share fierce claws and squat, feline faces, but every ryokido shell is unique, as distinctive as a fingerprint. Each heavy carapace bears an identifying arrangement of colourful, textured patterns, with some hereditary markings idiosyncratic to one’s village and clan.Ryokido carry telepathic power and are capable of sharing thoughts and feelings from soul to soul. This ability to connect with other creatures fosters an incredible empathy in ryokido; they are united through triumph, joy, and pain, and are troubled greatly by the suffering of others.\nEach ryokido village has a miko, a female shaman who acts as a guardian of the clans’ collective memory. A dying ryokido can telepathically surrender their mind in totality, pouring every memory, passion, and thought into the mind of another. The miko’s job is to receive this final gift: a lifetime of experience, perspective, and wisdom from the dying. In this way, knowledge is never lost, and the village is forever guided by the collective wisdom of those who came before them.Ryokido have a long, living history, borne on a stream of shared memory and experience. They find great value in family and community, raising pups as a village, and viewing those they surround themselves with as extensions of themselves. To the ryokido, every friend is family, every family a village, every village a legion. When moved to action, a single ryokido walks as an army.As a ryokido, you have the following traits:","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#race"],"headers":[{"heading":"Ryokido Info","level":1,"id":"Ryokido_Info_0"},{"heading":"Telepathic Connection","level":2,"id":"Telepathic_Connection_0"},{"heading":"Ties Of Family","level":2,"id":"Ties_Of_Family_0"},{"heading":"Ryokido Traits","level":1,"id":"Ryokido_Traits_0"}],"links":[],"author":"Rasmus","coverImageURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/raceimages/ryokido.webp","fullURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/94_character_creation/races/ryokido.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":["00_attachments/raceimages/ryokido.webp"],"createdTime":1752940679566,"modifiedTime":1765273745083,"sourceSize":4845,"sourcePath":"94_Character_Creation/Races/Ryokido.md","exportPath":"94_character_creation/races/ryokido.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":311,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"94_character_creation/races/tatsumi.html":{"title":"Tatsumi","icon":"","description":"<img alt=\"Tatsumi.webp\" src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/raceimages/tatsumi.webp\" target=\"_self\"><br>\n<img alt=\"Ryujin.webp\" src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/raceimages/ryujin.webp\" target=\"_self\">Along the lowland, nutrient-rich lakes and bubbling freshwater streams that branch throughout the Yokai Realms, the twin peoples of the tatsumi make home. With a meticulously charted history that stretches across aeons, the tatsumi’s ancestors are said to be the seed from which all dragons and dragon-folk sprung forth into the world. A hardy, bipedal, industrious folk, they are renowned for their colourful, moon-blessed scales and powerful builds.Whereas some races display obvious sexual dimorphism—females being larger, males being more colourful—what separates the two categories of tatsumi is experience. All tatsumi are born as nishikin, aquatic fish-folk with an appearance not dissimilar to the revered koi. After a moment of life-changing significance—for example, a great tragedy, achieving a lifelong goal, or a moment of epiphany—that tatsumi undergoes an overnight transformation. Much as a koi fish becomes a koi dragon when the latter leaves this world, a ryūjin emerges from this metamorphosis. A physically and physiologically different creature stands in the nishikin’s place, with the features and magic of their draconic ancestors fully realised.The difference between the two morphs of tatsumi is most poignant in matters of tradition and record-keeping. Nishikin keep detailed records of their own peoples, including ryūjin who live with them. However, of the ryūjin who leave, little is known.\nCurious wanderers, ryūjin have no cities, libraries, palaces, or temples; those who leave tatsumi communities seek to forge their own destinies. A pair of ryūjin may travel together for a time, form a close connection, and raise a family of nishikin children, but they typically part ways once the young are old enough to set out on their own adventure. A servant to their whims and the hands of fate, the story of no two ryūjin is the same.All nishikin possess a roiling heart of warmth and power within. Usually, this inner strength acts invisibly, a well of energy that drives a nishikin onwards with incredible longevity and vitality. In moments of great endeavour, however, the slumbering dragon awakens and briefly manifests as a tangible ally and guide. On rare occasions, nishikin who undergo transformative experiences of great euphoria or tragedy can even metamorphose into an actual dragon: a ryūjin. This transformation is not a certainty; many nishikin never metamorphose, but for those that do, it is accompanied by a change in perspective and mindset—an evolution of outlook as well as form.The diligence of the nishikin is legendary, their history overflowing with tales of explorers, hunters, crafters, and teachers who dedicated their lives to their pursuits. Nishikin hurl themselves into new experiences, dangers, and passions with alarming fervour, rarely entertaining more than one pursuit at a time and focusing solely on its mastery before moving on. The life of a nishikin is often an exhausting one, an endless trail of passion and dedication. From birth until death, nishikin struggle to tolerate rest or relaxation for any length of time.Ryūjin are closely related to nishikin, having transformed from the aquatic fish-folk into a new, draconic form. Although such a metamorphosis is seen as transcendent and incredible by many outside races, ryūjin are not revered or elevated above their nishikin family in their own society; in instances where they live together, they live harmoniously.The life of a ryūjin is often shaped by a search for new meanings, perspectives, and opportunity. For many, this means a path of joyful travel and exploration, but for others, it may mean the start of a family, or adopting a position of counsel among their nishikin kinsfolk. Ryūjin are widely noted as being significantly more relaxed than their nishikin counterparts, willing to pause and watch the world go by, unburdened by the nishikin’s ceaseless pursuit of growth and change.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#race"],"headers":[{"heading":"Tatsumi Info","level":1,"id":"Tatsumi_Info_0"},{"heading":"Twin Chapters","level":2,"id":"Twin_Chapters_0"},{"heading":"Half-Remembered History","level":2,"id":"Half-Remembered_History_0"},{"heading":"Tatsumi Traits","level":1,"id":"Tatsumi_Traits_0"},{"heading":"Primary Colouration","level":2,"id":"Primary_Colouration_0"},{"heading":"Nishikin","level":2,"id":"Nishikin_0"},{"heading":"Restless Ambition","level":3,"id":"Restless_Ambition_0"},{"heading":"Nishikin Traits","level":3,"id":"Nishikin_Traits_0"},{"heading":"Ryūjin","level":2,"id":"Ryūjin_0"},{"heading":"Body Altered, Mind Transformed","level":3,"id":"Body_Altered,_Mind_Transformed_0"},{"heading":"Ryūjin Traits","level":3,"id":"Ryūjin_Traits_0"}],"links":[],"author":"Rasmus","coverImageURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/raceimages/tatsumi.webp","fullURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/94_character_creation/races/tatsumi.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":["00_attachments/raceimages/tatsumi.webp","00_attachments/raceimages/ryujin.webp"],"createdTime":1752940972101,"modifiedTime":1765273748565,"sourceSize":12588,"sourcePath":"94_Character_Creation/Races/Tatsumi.md","exportPath":"94_character_creation/races/tatsumi.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":312,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"94_character_creation/races/tengu.html":{"title":"Tengu","icon":"","description":"<img alt=\"Hanataka Tengu.webp\" src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/raceimages/hanataka-tengu.webp\" target=\"_self\"><br>\n<img alt=\"Karasu Tengu.webp\" src=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/00_attachments/raceimages/karasu-tengu.webp\" target=\"_self\">In the sprawling forests that clothe the land from frosty mountainside to fertile shore, verdant life is cultivated and protected by a race of aloof guardians: the tengu. Mischievous, prideful, and territorial, tengu are a race of long-lived yokai. They make their home in the treetops, nimbly navigating precarious pathways as noiselessly as a shadow passes along the forest floor. Although typically reclusive, younger tengu have a sparkling curiosity toward the outside world, taking earnest interest in those who visit their domain. To all who trespass, however, a subtle threat is ever present. Harm not the forest, lest the wrath of the tengu fall like a crushing oak.As yokai, tengu are innately magical. Their natural powers lean towards trickery and illusion, allowing them to strike both the mind and body in a dazzling battery of lethal force. To many tengu, swordplay is a way of life—both a meditative practice and a form of self-defence. The resolute tengu swordmaster, a crackling visage of shadowy magic and slashing steel, is one found throughout the folklore and legends of many other peoples.Tengu draw upon an ancient legacy of proud tradition and discipline. Funerals, births, and tournaments are all governed by a strict cultural code, a way of life passed down from generation to generation. Tengu weddings are among the most spectacular sights in the realms, transforming entire forests into beautiful, shimmering forums of magic and light. Each moment of such a ceremony is dictated by long standing traditions brimming with significance, and every tengu is raised to understand the value of such rituals, embracing the unbroken line of wisdom that stretches to time immemorial.As a tengu, you have the following traits:Less ferocious and impulsive than the karasu, hanataka are widely regarded as the “higher” lineage of tengu. With the patience and tenacity of a flowing river, they live, train, and meditate in the towering trees of their mountain home. Hanataka tengu are swiftly provoked by vanity and are quick to humble the arrogant and foolish. To those who show respect, however, elder hanataka tengu make sage counsellors and guides, imparting the wisdom of age and yokai magic. Legend tells that the great warriors of old honed their swiftness of blade and sharpness of mind under the guidance of hanataka masters.Deceptive and witty, cunning and dangerous, karasu tengu are tricksters at heart. They take great joy in pranks, be they simple or elaborate, and cackle gleefully at the humbling of others. Karasu have many avian qualities, including vestigial, feathered wings and powerful, snapping beaks. As bursting with life as their forest homes, and as volatile and passionate as the tempestuous winds, the friendship of a karasu is one of staunch trust and joy. Those who insult them, however, find karasu grudges run long, deep, and deadly.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#race"],"headers":[{"heading":"Tengu

- Bard","icon":"","description":"Abjuration cantripCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 1 round\nClass: Bard, Cleric, Druid, Tamer, WizardChoose a willing creature within range that you can see. Until the end of your next turn, that creature is immune to the prone condition. If it is already prone and is not restrained, this spell sets it on its feet.\nThe number of creatures you can simultaneously target with this spell increases by 1 when you reach 5th level (2 creatures), 11th level (3 creatures), and 17th level (4 creatures).Abjuration cantripCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 1 round\nClass: Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, WizardYou temporarily tangle the Weave around a creature within range that you can see. Until the start of your next turn, each time the creature tries to cast a cantrip whilst this spell affects it, it must succeed on a spellcasting ability check against your spell save DC or waste its action (but not a spell slot). The spell ends if the target moves out of the spell’s range.\nThe maximum level of spell inhibited by this cantrip increases when you reach 5th level (1st-level spells), 11th level (2nd-level spells), and 17th level (3rd-level spells).Biomancy cantrip (*can be replaced with transmutation)Casting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nClass: Bard, Druid, Sorcerer, Tamer, WarlockWith a pulse of adrenaline, a tremendous ferocity comes upon you. Make one weapon attack against a target within your reach or range. If this attack hits, the target takes additional 1d4 damage of the weapon’s damage type.\nThis spell’s damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4) and 17th level (4d4).Enchantment cantripCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (small magnifying lens)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nClass: Bard, Druid, TamerA willing creature you touch gains a preternatural ability to perceive the weaknesses in a creature’s defenses. The first time the creature makes an attack while under the effect of this spell, it makes the attack with advantage. After it makes an attack, the spell ends.\nThis spell augments the creature’s ability to strike at vital points when you reach certain levels. When you reach 5th level, the augmented attack scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20. At 11th level, this range is increased to 18 to 20, and at 17th level, this range becomes 17 to 20.1st-level abjurationCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nClass: Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, WizardChoose a creature you can see within range. Each time the target tries to cast a spell of equal or lower level than this spell, it must succeed on a spellcasting ability check against your spell save DC or waste its action (but not its spell slot).\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you inhibit spells 1 spell level higher for each slot level above 1st.1st-level biomancy (*can be replaced with transmutation)Casting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (red, yellow, and blue pigment)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nClass: Bard, Druid, Ranger, Tamer, WizardYou imbue a creature you touch with pigment so that its skin, and anything it wears or carries, slowly shifts hues to match its surroundings. For the duration, the target can take the Hide action as a bonus action on each of its turns, even when only lightly obscured.\nIf the target did not move during its last turn, creatures have disadvantage on any Wisdom (Perception) checks made to see the target. Creatures who do not rely on sight, such as those with tremorsense, are immune to this effect.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st.1st-level enchantmentCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a tiny, four-panelled window)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nClass: Bard, Druid, WarlockYou float some mildly distracting thoughts into the mind of a humanoid you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks (taking a -5 penalty to its passive Perception as a result of this disadvantage) until the spell ends. A creature immune to being charmed is unaffected by this spell.\nA creature that succeeds on the saving throw by 5 or more is aware that an attempt was made to influence it with magic. Otherwise, the creature remains unaware of the magic that affected it.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st, or you can extend the range of the spell by 30 feet for each slot level above 1st.1st-level transmutationCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (adhesive tape with ducks drawn on it)\nDuration: 10 minutes\nClass: Bard, Cleric, Sorcerer, WizardYou imbue a broken item no larger than 20 feet in any dimension with pure belief. For the duration, the item is whole once more. In addition, if you were familiar with the item’s magical function (GM’s discretion) and its rarity was no higher than common, the item regains its magical properties for the duration.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the rarity of the item that can regain its magical properties increases to uncommon (3rd level), rare (5th level), very rare (7th level), or legendary (9th level).1st-level transmutationCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self (15-foot cone)\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 round\nClass: Bard, Sorcerer, WarlockYou belch forward acidic fumes, afflicting those in a 15-foot cone before you. The fumes spread around corners. All creatures in the area must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 3d4 acid damage on a failure or half as much damage on a success.\nThe fumes linger until the end of your next turn or until dispersed by a moderate or stronger wind. Any creature ending its turn in the area must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 3d4 acid damage or half as much damage on a success.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage (both initial and later) increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 1st.1st-level enchantmentCasting Time: 1 reaction, which you take when initiative is rolled\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a coffee bean)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nClass: Bard, Ranger, Sorcerer, Tamer, WizardAs a reaction when initiative is rolled, choose a willing creature you can see within range; it begins to subtly jitter as its pupils dilate. If the target is surprised, it is no longer surprised, and takes its turn on the first round as normal. If the target is not surprised, it gains advantage on the initiative roll that prompted this spell.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you may target one additional creature for each spell slot above 1st.2nd-level enchantment (ritual)Casting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a tiny dreamcatcher)\nDuration: 24 hours\nClass: Bard, Druid, Ranger, Warlock, WizardChoose up to ten willing creatures you can see within range. For the duration, they gain the ability to lucidly dream whenever they sleep. While lucid dreaming, a creature always knows if the dream spell is being used to target it. In addition, when you cast this spell, each creature affected by it can choose to instantly fall asleep, even if that creature has a trait that normally prevents it from being magically put to sleep (such as elves’ Fey Ancestry).2nd-level enchantmentCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a drop of blood and water, mixed)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nClass: Bard, Cleric, Paladin, TamerYou twist the fates of two creatures you can see, both of whom must be within range. Choose one target to favour and one to disfavour. The disfavoured target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or the following effects occur:\nWhenever the favoured target makes an attack roll or saving throw before the spell ends, the favoured target can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the attack or saving throw.\nWhenever the disfavoured target makes an attack roll or saving throw before the spell ends, the disfavoured target must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from the attack or saving throw.\nThe disfavoured target’s speed is halved, whilst the favoured target’s speed increases by half.\nThese effects end for the pair if either of the target pair is knocked unconscious, killed, or the spell ends. While under the influence of this spell, a favoured target can’t benefit from the bless spell, and a disfavoured target can’t be afflicted by the bane spell.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can link two other creatures, favouring one, and disfavouring the other, for each two slot levels above 2nd.\n2nd-level abjurationCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a miniature silver shield worth 10 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\nClass: Bard, Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Ranger, TamerYou trace a warding sigil in the air, sending it to slowly circle a willing creature you can see for the next hour. Immediately before the target next takes damage, except psychic damage, the ward triggers. Until the end of the target’s next turn, it has resistance to all damage excluding psychic, including the triggering damage. The warding sigil then disappears, and the spell ends on the target.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you may target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.2nd-level abjurationCasting Time: 1 reaction, which you take when a creature within range that you can see is hit by an attack from an attacker you can see or fails a Strength or Dexterity saving throw\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V\nDuration: 1 round\nClass: Bard, Cleric, Paladin, Sorcerer, TamerWith a word, you coat a creature in a shimmering shield that absorbs the energy of incoming blows. The creature gains 15 temporary hit points the instant before it takes the triggering damage. These hit points last until the start of the creature’s next turn.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you may choose to either increase the range of the spell by 30 feet or increase the number of temporary hit points gained by 5, for each slot level above 2nd.2nd-level biomancy (*can be replaced with transmutation)Casting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (some candy)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nClass: Bard, Cleric, Paladin, Sorcerer, TamerChoose a willing creature that you can see within range. Until the spell ends, the target’s speed is increased by 15 feet, and it gains a +1 bonus to AC. As a bonus action on each of its turns, it can take the Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action.\nWhen the spell ends, or if an affected creature does not spend movement up to its walking speed by the end of its turn, it then develops a stomach ache and is poisoned until the end of its next turn.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd-level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.3rd-level enchantmentCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet (20-foot-radius sphere)\nComponents: V, S, M (a red handkerchief)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nClass: Bard, Sorcerer, WarlockYou attempt to create violent emotions in a group of people. Each humanoid in a 20-foot-radius sphere centred on a point you choose within range must make a Charisma saving throw; a creature can choose to fail this saving throw if it wishes. A creature that fails this saving throw becomes enraged for the duration. While enraged, a target becomes hostile towards all creatures. An enraged creature that is concentrating on a spell must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw at the start of each of its turns or lose concentration on the spell.\nAs an action, you can force an enraged creature to use its reaction to make one melee weapon attack against one randomly determined creature within the enraged creature’s reach. If the enraged creature was friendly towards the target of its attack before this spell was cast, the enraged creature can repeat the saving throw immediately after making the attack, ending the effect on itself on a success.\nAn enraged creature can repeat the saving throw whenever it takes damage, ending the effect on itself on a success. When the spell ends, the creature reverts to its previous disposition again, unless the GM rules otherwise.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher and use an action to force an enraged creature to make a melee weapon attack, you can force one additional enraged creature to make a melee weapon attack for each slot level above 3rd.3rd-level enchantment (ritual)Casting Time: 1 minute\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a turkey drumstick and a cranberry-coloured ruby worth at least 50 gp, both of which the spell consumes)\nDuration: 1 hour\nClass: Bard, Cleric, Druid, Paladin, TamerYou crush a ruby into dust, sprinkling it over a turkey drumstick, which wafts with an alluring aroma. A willing creature that entirely consumes the meat of this drumstick falls asleep and is unconscious for 1 hour, drowning out the sound of relatives asking whether they have a boyfriend yet or when they expect to have babies.\nYou can only be woken early by taking damage or by a greater restoration or wish spell. At the end of the hour, you wake feeling refreshed and have all of your hit points restored. If you are woken prematurely, the spell ends with no effect and you are grumpy.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you may enchant an additional turkey drumstick (and hence affect one additional creature) for each slot level above 3rd.3rd-level conjurationCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 150 feet (15-foot-radius sphere)\nComponents: V, S, M (a tiny ball of guano and mud)\nDuration: 1 minute\nClass: Bard, Druid, Sorcerer, WarlockA blob of gloopy mud splunks from your pointed finger to a point you choose within range, where it splooges with a wet burp into an explosion of sludge. Each creature in a 15-foot-radius sphere centred on that point must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 3d10 bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. On a successful one, it takes half as much damage and is not knocked prone.\nIn addition, all surfaces within the area become covered in unpredictably slick and sticky patches of mud for the duration. The first time a creature moves through the muddy area on its turn it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or fall prone. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn’t need to make the saving throw.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 3rd.3rd-level conjurationCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 90 feet (20-foot-radius sphere)\nComponents: V, S, M (a skunk’s tail)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nClass: Bard, Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, WizardEmanating from a point within range, a noxious, 20-foot-radius sphere of colourless fumes creates a choking, eye-watering miasma that penetrates through creatures’ skin.\nWhen a creature enters the spell’s area for the first time on its turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Constitution saving throw. It takes 3d6 poison damage and becomes poisoned until the end of its next turn on a failure, or takes half as much damage and is not poisoned on a success. Whilst poisoned in this way, a creature has disadvantage on saving throws made to maintain its concentration.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.3rd-level transmutationCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 90 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nClass: Bard, Cleric, Sorcerer, Tamer, Warlock, WizardYou attempt to switch places with a Large or smaller target within range that you can see. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or instantly teleport to your space whilst you teleport to the one it previously occupied.\nA creature automatically succeeds on this saving throw if there is not enough space to accommodate either of the teleporting creatures. A willing creature may choose to fail the saving throw.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the range of this spell increases by 30 feet for each slot level above 3rd. The maximum size of creature you can target increases to Huge when cast at 6th level or higher, and to Gargantuan when cast at 9th level.4th-level abjurationCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a pair of manacles)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nClass: Bard, Cleric, Paladin, WarlockYou link the vitality of a willing creature within range—the source—to the psyche of another creature within range—the target. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or become linked to the source for 1 minute. Each time the source takes damage, the target takes psychic damage equal to half the damage the source took. If you yourself are the source, the creature takes this damage immediately before you make a Constitution saving throw to maintain your concentration. Whenever the target takes damage in this way, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.4th-level transmutationCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (adhesive tape with gorillas drawn on it)\nDuration: 1 hour\nClass: Bard, WizardYou touch one item, instilling it with levels of belief worthy of a kobold and granting it one of the following properties, based on the item type, for the duration.\nArmour. A creature wearing this armour gains 1d4 temporary hit points at the start of each of its turns.\nBelt. A creature wearing this belt gains a flying speed of 30 feet.\nBoots. A creature wearing these boots has its walking speed increased by 10 feet and its jump distance tripled.\nCloak. A creature wearing this cloak has advantage on Stealth checks it makes to hide and can hide while only lightly obscured.\nGloves. A creature wearing these gloves gains a climbing speed equal to its walking speed and can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check. Additionally, it has advantage on any ability checks it makes related to grappling.\nHeadwear. A creature wearing this headwear doesn’t need to breathe, has advantage on saving throws against being poisoned, and has resistance to poison damage.\nYou can end this spell early by touching the item. The spell ends if you cast it again.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can target one additional item for each slot level above 4th.\n5th-level transmutationCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nClass: Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Tamer, Warlock, WizardYou touch a willing creature, causing it, and everything it is wearing and carrying, to become translucent. At the start of each of the target’s turns for the duration, it can choose to become incorporeal (no action required) until the end of its turn. While incorporeal, it has advantage on Stealth checks; it gains resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage; and it can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. If the target ends its turn inside an object, it is shunted to the nearest unoccupied space, taking 1d10 force damage for every 5 feet it is shunted.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot level of 6th level or higher, you can choose to increase the spell’s duration, or the number of targets, for each slot level above 5th. If you choose duration, the duration increases in increments to 10 minutes (6th level), 1 hour (7th level), 8 hours (8th level), or 24 hours (9th level). If you choose to increase the number of targets, the number increases by 1 for each slot level.6th-level abjurationCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 90 feet (20-foot-radius sphere)\nComponents: V, S, M (a piece of felt)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nClass: Bard, Sorcerer, WizardYou imperceptibly tangle the threads of the Weave in a 20-foot-radius sphere centred on a point you can see within range. Whenever a creature attempts to cast a spell of 1st level or higher in this area, it must make an ability check with its spellcasting ability against your spell save DC. On a success, the spell is cast as normal. On a failure, the spellcaster casts the spell and produces an additional effect. Roll a d10 and consult the following table to determine the additional effect:Any additional spell cast this way targets or is centred on the spellcaster, who has no control over the spell’s effects. The DC for any saving throws equals the spellcaster’s spell save DC. In the case of concentration spells, no concentration is required. At initiative count 20 of each round, roll a d20 for each ongoing additional effect. On a roll of 11 or higher, that effect ends.\nAt Higher Levels.

If you yourself are the source, the creature takes this damage immediately before you make a Constitution saving throw to maintain your concentration. Whenever the target takes damage in this way, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.5th-level biomancy (*can be replaced with necromancy)Casting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self (20-foot-radius sphere)\nComponents: V, S, M (the bones of at least one non-animated corpse, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: 1 minute\nClass: Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Warlock, WizardYou draw the bones from all corpses within range, forming a carapace of ribcages and femurs.

Each time an affected creature takes damage that would reduce its hit points to 0, it makes a death saving throw instead. If the creature fails 3 death saving throws, it dies.\nWhen the spell ends, the creature gains a level of exhaustion for each death saving throw it failed. If the creature is resurrected after dying from these failed death saving throws, it does not regain consciousness for a duration equal to the time for which this spell affected it. When it wakes, it gains 3 levels of exhaustion.\nIf the creature is still alive when the spell ends, it falls unconscious for a duration equal to the time for which this spell affected it.

At the start of each of the target’s turns for the duration, it can choose to become incorporeal (no action required) until the end of its turn. While incorporeal, it has advantage on Stealth checks; it gains resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage; and it can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. If the target ends its turn inside an object, it is shunted to the nearest unoccupied space, taking 1d10 force damage for every 5 feet it is shunted.\nAt Higher Levels.

On a successful one, it takes half as much damage and is not knocked prone.\nIn addition, all surfaces within the area become covered in unpredictably slick and sticky patches of mud for the duration. The first time a creature moves through the muddy area on its turn it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or fall prone. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn’t need to make the saving throw.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 3rd.3rd-level conjurationCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 90 feet (20-foot-radius sphere)\nComponents: V, S, M (a skunk’s tail)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nClass: Bard, Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, WizardEmanating from a point within range, a noxious, 20-foot-radius sphere of colourless fumes creates a choking, eye-watering miasma that penetrates through creatures’ skin.\nWhen a creature enters the spell’s area for the first time on its turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Constitution saving throw.

On a failed save, the target takes 5d8 poison damage and is poisoned for 1 minute. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and isn’t poisoned. If the target is completely submerged in water, increase the damage dice from d8s to d10s.\nThe target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.\nAt Higher Levels.

The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become silenced as its mouth is fused shut for the duration. If you silence a target that is casting a spell with verbal components, the target’s spell slot isn’t expended, but its action is wasted.\nAt the end of each of its turns, the target can make a Strength saving throw as it tries to tear open its mouth. On a success, the target takes 1d8 slashing damage and is no longer silenced. Alternatively, as an action, the target can use a bladed implement to cut open its mouth, taking 1d8 slashing damage and ending the silence.\nAt Higher Levels.

If the creature fails 3 death saving throws, it dies.\nWhen the spell ends, the creature gains a level of exhaustion for each death saving throw it failed. If the creature is resurrected after dying from these failed death saving throws, it does not regain consciousness for a duration equal to the time for which this spell affected it.

A creature with an Intelligence score of 4 or lower automatically succeeds on the saving throw.\nIf a creature fails the initial saving throw then, on each of your turns for the duration, you can use your action to force the creature to make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 4d6 psychic damage and you learn something about the creature (roll a d6 and consult the table above). On a success, the creature takes half as much damage, you don’t learn anything, and the spell ends. The spell also ends if the target is ever outside the spell’s range.\nAt Higher Levels.

Each creature in a 15-foot-radius sphere centred on that point must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 3d10 bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. On a successful one, it takes half as much damage and is not knocked prone.\nIn addition, all surfaces within the area become covered in unpredictably slick and sticky patches of mud for the duration. The first time a creature moves through the muddy area on its turn it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or fall prone. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn’t need to make the saving throw.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 3rd.3rd-level conjurationCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 90 feet (20-foot-radius sphere)\nComponents: V, S, M (a skunk’s tail)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nClass: Bard, Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, WizardEmanating from a point within range, a noxious, 20-foot-radius sphere of colourless fumes creates a choking, eye-watering miasma that penetrates through creatures’ skin.\nWhen a creature enters the spell’s area for the first time on its turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Constitution saving throw. It takes 3d6 poison damage and becomes poisoned until the end of its next turn on a failure, or takes half as much damage and is not poisoned on a success.

A willing creature may choose to fail the saving throw.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the range of this spell increases by 30 feet for each slot level above 3rd. The maximum size of creature you can target increases to Huge when cast at 6th level or higher, and to Gargantuan when cast at 9th level.3rd-level biomancy (*can be replaced with transmutation)Casting Time: 1 action\nRange: 90 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nClass: Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, WizardYou assault the internal chemistry of a creature you can see within range, causing bubbles of nitrogen to precipitate in its blood, forcing it to make a Constitution saving throw.

The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become silenced as its mouth is fused shut for the duration. If you silence a target that is casting a spell with verbal components, the target’s spell slot isn’t expended, but its action is wasted.\nAt the end of each of its turns, the target can make a Strength saving throw as it tries to tear open its mouth. On a success, the target takes 1d8 slashing damage and is no longer silenced. Alternatively, as an action, the target can use a bladed implement to cut open its mouth, taking 1d8 slashing damage and ending the silence.\nAt Higher Levels.

If the spell has an area of effect, you can shift the area of effect up to 10 feet in any direction. If the creature is casting a spell of 4th level or higher, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a success, the creature’s spell is redirected as described.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the spell is automatically redirected as described if its level is less than the level of the spell slot you used.5th-level biomancy (*can be replaced with evocation)Casting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S, M (a red hot chilli pepper, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nClass: Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Tamer, Warlock, WizardYou eat a chilli pepper, your metabolism increases, and your skin begins to burn to the touch.

When the spell ends, the gravity reaches a critical magnitude, smashing all creatures in the cylinder downwards; each creature in the area must make a Strength saving throw. If the spell lasts its full duration and ends at the start of your next turn, then, on a failed saving throw, a creature takes 8d10 force damage and is knocked prone.

A creature suffocating in this way can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending its suffocation on a success.\nA creature that does not need to breathe is immune to the effects of this spell.

On a success, the spell is cast as normal. On a failure, the spellcaster casts the spell and produces an additional effect. Roll a d10 and consult the following table to determine the additional effect:Any additional spell cast this way targets or is centred on the spellcaster, who has no control over the spell’s effects. The DC for any saving throws equals the spellcaster’s spell save DC. In the case of concentration spells, no concentration is required. At initiative count 20 of each round, roll a d20 for each ongoing additional effect. On a roll of 11 or higher, that effect ends.\nAt Higher Levels.

A creature made of ferrous metal or wearing ferrous armour has disadvantage on this Strength saving throw.\nThe area is difficult terrain for any creatures made of ferrous metal or wearing ferrous armour.\nAt Higher Levels.

Choose an unoccupied space within range. An aberration of challenge rating 5 or lower (GM’s choice) appears in the space. The aberration disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.\nThe aberration is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. Roll initiative for the aberration, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any commands to the aberration, it defends itself from hostile creatures, but otherwise takes no actions.\nIf your concentration is broken, the aberration doesn’t disappear. Instead, you lose control of the aberration, it becomes hostile towards you and your companions, and it might attack. An uncontrolled aberration can’t be dismissed by you, and it disappears 1 hour after you summoned it.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the challenge rating increases by 1 for each slot level above 5th.5th-level necromancyCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a gem-encrusted cockroach worth 250 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: 1 minute\nClass: Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Ranger, Tamer, WarlockChoose a willing creature you can see within range; it ceases to heed the pained calls of its body, needing neither food nor water to exist. An affected creature ignores the effects of exhaustion, the poisoned condition, and cannot be incapacitated, stunned, paralysed, or fall unconscious. Each time an affected creature takes damage that would reduce its hit points to 0, it makes a death saving throw instead. If the creature fails 3 death saving throws, it dies.\nWhen the spell ends, the creature gains a level of exhaustion for each death saving throw it failed. If the creature is resurrected after dying from these failed death saving throws, it does not regain consciousness for a duration equal to the time for which this spell affected it. When it wakes, it gains 3 levels of exhaustion.\nIf the creature is still alive when the spell ends, it falls unconscious for a duration equal to the time for which this spell affected it. Whilst unconscious in this way, the creature can not be awakened by any means short of a wish spell.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can increase the duration to 10 minutes (6th level), 1 hour (7th level), 8 hours (8th level) or 1 day (9th level).5th-level biomancy (*can be replaced with evocation)Casting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S, M (a red hot chilli pepper, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nClass: Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Tamer, Warlock, WizardYou eat a chilli pepper, your metabolism increases, and your skin begins to burn to the touch. Make a melee spell attack against a creature within your reach. On a hit, the target takes 6d6 fire damage. Until the spell ends, you can use an action on each of your subsequent turns to make this attack again.\nFor the duration, your walking speed increases by 15 feet, and you gain 2d6 temporary hit points at the start of each of your turns.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 5th.5th-level evocationCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet (40-foot-radius, 100-foot-high cylinder)\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 round\nClass: Sorcerer, Warlock, WizardYou strike the ground, choosing a point you can see within range to begin accumulating gravity. A 40-foot-radius, 100-foot-high cylinder centered on that point becomes difficult terrain until the start of your next turn. When the spell ends, the gravity reaches a critical magnitude, smashing all creatures in the cylinder downwards; each creature in the area must make a Strength saving throw. If the spell lasts its full duration and ends at the start of your next turn, then, on a failed saving throw, a creature takes 8d10 force damage and is knocked prone. If the spell ends before the start of your next turn, a creature takes 4d10 force damage on a failure instead. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t knocked prone.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, both damage values increase by 1d10 for each slot level above 5th.5th-level transmutationCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nClass: Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Tamer, Warlock, WizardYou touch a willing creature, causing it, and everything it is wearing and carrying, to become translucent. At the start of each of the target’s turns for the duration, it can choose to become incorporeal (no action required) until the end of its turn. While incorporeal, it has advantage on Stealth checks; it gains resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage; and it can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. If the target ends its turn inside an object, it is shunted to the nearest unoccupied space, taking 1d10 force damage for every 5 feet it is shunted.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot level of 6th level or higher, you can choose to increase the spell’s duration, or the number of targets, for each slot level above 5th. If you choose duration, the duration increases in increments to 10 minutes (6th level), 1 hour (7th level), 8 hours (8th level), or 24 hours (9th level). If you choose to increase the number of targets, the number increases by 1 for each slot level.6th-level biomancy (*can be replaced with evocation)Casting Time: 1 action\nRange: 90 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nClass: Sorcerer, Warlock, WizardYou cause rapid and unpredictable changes in the internal air pressure of a creature you can see, rupturing its breathing apparatus. The creature must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature that is holding its breath makes this saving throw with disadvantage. On a failure, a creature takes 7d6 thunder damage, 7d6 necrotic damage, and immediately begins suffocating. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and does not begin suffocating. A creature suffocating in this way can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending its suffocation on a success.\nA creature that does not need to breathe is immune to the effects of this spell. A greater restoration, heal, or wish spell can restore a creature’s ability to breathe, and end its suffocation.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the thunder and necrotic damage both increase by 1d6 for each slot level above 6th.7th-level evocationCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 150 feet (ten 10-foot cubes)\nComponents: V, S, M (a piece of bismuth)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nClass: Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, WizardA storm made of crackling lightning and arcanomagnetic winds appears in a location you choose within range. The area of the storm consists of up to ten 10-foot cubes, which you can arrange as you wish and last until the spell ends. Each cube must have at least one face adjacent to the face of another cube. As a bonus action at the start of each of your turns, you can remove one 10-foot cube, and place another 10-foot-cube adjacent to the face of another cube.\nEach creature that starts its turn in the area or enters the area for the first time on its turn must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d8 lightning damage on a failure, or half as much damage on a success. Each creature that ends its turn in the area must make a Strength saving throw, taking 4d8 force damage and being knocked prone on a failure, or taking half as much damage and not being knocked prone on a success. A creature made of ferrous metal or wearing ferrous armour has disadvantage on this Strength saving throw.\nThe area is difficult terrain for any creatures made of ferrous metal or wearing ferrous armour.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the lightning and force damage both increase by 1d8 for each slot level above 7th.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Can’trip","level":1,"id":"Can’trip_0"},{"heading":"Concussion","level":1,"id":"Concussion_0"},{"heading":"Ferocious Strike","level":1,"id":"Ferocious_Strike_0"},{"heading":"Magnetobolt","level":1,"id":"Magnetobolt_0"},{"heading":"Pins &amp; Needles","level":1,"id":"Pins_&_Needles_0"},{"heading":"Spark","level":1,"id":"Spark_0"},{"heading":"Spore Cloud","level":1,"id":"Spore_Cloud_0"},{"heading":"Swarm","level":1,"id":"Swarm_0"},{"heading":"Cannotrip","level":1,"id":"Cannotrip_0"},{"heading":"Corrupting Ichor","level":1,"id":"Corrupting_Ichor_0"},{"heading":"Daydream","level":1,"id":"Daydream_0"},{"heading":"Humperdink’s Halitosis","level":1,"id":"Humperdink’s_Halitosis_0"},{"heading":"Arcanomagnetic Repulsion","level":1,"id":"Arcanomagnetic_Repulsion_0"},{"heading":"Dreamwalk","level":1,"id":"Dreamwalk_0"},{"heading":"Eelskin","level":1,"id":"Eelskin_0"},{"heading":"Endoleech","level":1,"id":"Endoleech_0"},{"heading":"Mortiferous Pulse","level":1,"id":"Mortiferous_Pulse_0"},{"heading":"Peppermint Plate","level":1,"id":"Peppermint_Plate_0"},{"heading":"Riptide","level":1,"id":"Riptide_0"},{"heading":"Acid Rain","level":1,"id":"Acid_Rain_0"},{"heading":"Depth Charge","level":1,"id":"Depth_Charge_0"},{"heading":"Enrage","level":1,"id":"Enrage_0"},{"heading":"Firther’s Shadow","level":1,"id":"Firther’s_Shadow_0"},{"heading":"Influenza","level":1,"id":"Influenza_0"},{"heading":"Magnetite Shard","level":1,"id":"Magnetite_Shard_0"},{"heading":"Mass Leech","level":1,"id":"Mass_Leech_0"},{"heading":"Mireball","level":1,"id":"Mireball_0"},{"heading":"Stench","level":1,"id":"Stench_0"},{"heading":"The Bends","level":1,"id":"The_Bends_0"},{"heading":"Zippit!","level":1,"id":"Zippit!_0"},{"heading":"Aura of Impurity","level":1,"id":"Aura_of_Impurity_0"},{"heading":"Blinding Radiance","level":1,"id":"Blinding_Radiance_0"},{"heading":"Frogskin","level":1,"id":"Frogskin_0"},{"heading":"Fungal Infection","level":1,"id":"Fungal_Infection_0"},{"heading":"Gravity Repulsion","level":1,"id":"Gravity_Repulsion_0"},{"heading":"Shackles of Pain","level":1,"id":"Shackles_of_Pain_0"},{"heading":"Tentacle Lash","level":1,"id":"Tentacle_Lash_0"},{"heading":"Weavebend","level":1,"id":"Weavebend_0"},{"heading":"Bone Cage","level":1,"id":"Bone_Cage_0"},{"heading":"Conjure Anomaly","level":1,"id":"Conjure_Anomaly_0"},{"heading":"Endure","level":1,"id":"Endure_0"},{"heading":"Feverskin","level":1,"id":"Feverskin_0"},{"heading":"Gravity Smash","level":1,"id":"Gravity_Smash_0"},{"heading":"Incorporeality","level":1,"id":"Incorporeality_0"},{"heading":"Lungburst","level":1,"id":"Lungburst_0"},{"heading":"Arcanomagnetic Storm","level":1,"id":"Arcanomagnetic_Storm_0"}],"links":[],"author":"Rasmus","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/94_character_creation/spells/spells-warlock.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1753027013431,"modifiedTime":1769630779351,"sourceSize":48186,"sourcePath":"94_Character_Creation/Spells/Spells - Warlock.md","exportPath":"94_character_creation/spells/spells-warlock.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":431,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"94_character_creation/spells/spells-wizard.html":{"title":"Spells - Wizard","icon":"","description":"Abjuration cantripCasting Time:&nbsp;1&nbsp;action\nRange:&nbsp;30 feet\nComponents:&nbsp;V, S\nDuration:&nbsp;1 round\nClass:&nbsp;Bard, Cleric, Druid, Tamer, WizardChoose a willing creature within&nbsp;range&nbsp;that you can see.

där Cecil och Arvid finns ![[]]Tony är inte alls sugen på att stanna utan vill hem till Helm's Bearing så han får vila. Vi diskuterar lite men lyckas inte övertala honom. Han är helt bestämd på att dra hemåt nu. Vi går gemensamt till byn vi pratade om tidigare i alla fall så ska Tony skaffa sig en häst o dra hemåt.När vi kommer in i byn så hör vi en röst en bit bort som väldigt hest snackar om något. Verkar predika om lag och ordning, balans och rättvisa. Tony tycker inte om honom, eller i alla fall att Deegun inte är så himla go.Det kommer fram en man till oss och håller med Tony i hans åsikter. Han hälsar och introducerar sig som Horvald. Han säger att vi kanske får mer lycka gällande jobb om vi uppsöker Tom. Horvald har en stuga på andra sidan floden med ett björnhuvud ovanför dörren. Horvald säger plötsligt att han behöver dra och så fort han lämnat oss kommer Jimanuel och säger hej till oss.\nVi pratar lite och tänker att han ska få träffa Tony också som gick till tavernan. Vi går till tavernan och ser där Tony och även en hobgoblin med monokel som då ska vara Cecil. Vi pratar med Cecil lite gällande problemet men han verkar inte alls vara på hugget här. Men han rekommenderar oss till byns ålderman som kanske kan hjälpa till. Vi går dit och möts av en kvinna. Hon säger att han är vid kyrkan. Vi går till kyrkan som är en kyrka av Lyssa, samma som på Helm’s Bearing. Väl där inne hittar vi åldermannen, Tom Timmer, talandes med prästinnan, Levellin.Jimanuel avbryter dem och vi hälsar på dem och börjar förklara vad vi vart med om och vad vi funderar över. Prästinnan ska skicka en brevduva till klostret där hon blev upplärd.\nTom föreslår att vi går med honom hem till hans kontor och fortsätter prata. Hemmet han bor i är definitivt det finaste i denna byn. Vi kommer in och sätter oss och sen säger han att han framförallt har tankar och åsikter gällande problemet med banditerna som håller på.\nSen kallar han in Åsa som han introducerar och ber hämta lite dricka till oss alla. Vi introducerar varandra lite och strax efter kommer Åsa med glas och dricka till alla. Tom Timmer är inte alls intresserad av att prata om spöken i skogen eller Elisa. Vi får ut att han är övertygad om att hon är död och inget annat. Hon hade en man, Åber(?), som dog något år senare i en jaktolycka.Han ser att 3 av oss har symboler för ett gille. Han frågar vad vi brukar få betalt och jag slänger till med kanske 200gp per person för ett medelsvårt uppdrag. Han tvekar först men Jimanuel med en nat 20 lyckas övertala och han går med på det om vi också kollar på landet lite efter vi löst banditerna. Han säger att de har mest problem Öst-Nord-Öst om byn. De blev av med en leverans som skulle kommit för snart en vecka sedan. Han säger först att de inte har någon annan leverans som ska iväg närmsta tiden, men sen säger han hmmm.. joo vi har nog en vagn…… Han verkar påstå att vi kan ta en tom vagn de har. Vi fick nyckeln också till Elisas hem som vi ska gå in o kolla i.Vi möter Tony när vi kommer ut som precis köper sig en häst. Han ber Cory om hjälp gällande vilket håll han ska rida åt innan han far iväg.Vi gick och mötte Cecil och frågade gällande vagnen, och det verkade vara okej att vi lånar den en sväng.Vi går först in till Elisas hem och undersöker lite. Vi kommer in och Hilmia sniffar runt lite och märker att det luktar en del krydda i bostaden. Cory går runt och bankar på golvet och jag slänger Detect Magic från Bagge. Jag kan känna en tunn och svag presence av evocation-magi. Jag ser ingenting i något av de två rummen som håller på magin. Vi väljer att gå utanför huset. Medan jag går runt känner jag en till presence, men av illusionsmagi. Petar på den och märker att det är en illusory wall, så jag går in. Vi kommer in i en liten skrubb typ, där det är lite smått inrett. Finns någon byrå och en säng. Det är hela detta rummet som emanerar evocation-magin.\nDet är garanterat magi som får rummet att vara varmt, behagligt och levnadsbart. Cory undersöker och tror att det var 1-2 dygn sedan någon var här senast. Cory ser också att busken rakt utanför är lite hålig efter att någon har gått igenom den ganska mycket. Slutligen såg Cory också att det är björnspår som går ut till busken.\nHilmia tar med en strumpa hon hittade där nere.Vi bestämmer oss för att följa spåren. De leder oss förbi bärbuskar och bikupor. Men på vägen stöter vi också på en kristall i marken, som pulserar rytmiskt. Den verkar ha rotat sig i marken. Jag petar på den och då pulserar den direkt samt att dens rötter flyttar och roterar sig lite och riktar sig åt ett annat håll. Nu mer längsmed och emot samma håll som björnspåren går. Cory tittar och ser att något verkar kolla mot och inspektera oss inifrån skogen. Den smälter in väldigt väl med omgivande buskage, mark och träd. Det rör sig ganska fort men den flyter fram nästan lite onaturligt.\nCory tycker vi ska gömma oss, så vi gör det allihop. Jag rollar nat 1 på den.Både jag och Jimanuel failar detta. Vi ser snart dock vad det är för filur som kommer. Den lyser i ögonen och har en kropp av typ bark och trä. Vi börjar slåss mot dem och avslutar session mitt i fighten.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#session"],"headers":[{"heading":"Current agenda","level":1,"id":"Current_agenda_0"},{"heading":"Goals","level":7,"id":"Goals_0"},{"heading":"Session Summary","level":1,"id":"Session_Summary_0"},{"heading":"Recap of last session","level":1,"id":"Recap_of_last_session_0"},{"heading":"Log","level":1,"id":"Log_0"}],"links":[],"author":"Rasmus","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-59-2025-12-28.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":["05_quests/current-goals-singwin-mistforger.md"],"createdTime":1767627859018,"modifiedTime":1767627703117,"sourceSize":5752,"sourcePath":"02_Journal/Thalbrine - Big campaign/Session 59 - 2025-12-28.md","exportPath":"02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-59-2025-12-28.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":238,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-60-2026-01-05.html":{"title":"Session 60 - 2026-01-05","icon":"","description":"\nHitta ett sätt att få hem Holger\nFixa ett material med ursprung från the Astral Plane\nHälsa på Semil Wildmagic i Bastion Shore\nKomma på ett namn på byn där Cecil och Arvid finns ![[]]Fight fortsätter direkt. Vi har ihjäl alla ganska kvickt och sen kollar vi lite på träden vi slogs mot och Hilmia är intresserad av att kanske crafta något med dem. Vi tittar på dem tillsammans men tyvärr verkar dessa vara för sönderslagna för att jag ska kunna crafta något. Vi får försöka hålla dem lite mer hela om vi träffar på nån mer att ha ihjäl.Hilmia tar tag i en av trådarna som går mellan kristallerna vi hittat. Hon kan känna efter med skogen och ser att trådarna leder iväg mot nån kulle typ där de samlar sig. Vi bestämmer oss för att smyga fram efter mycket diskussioner med hjälp från Pass Without Trace. Desto längre vi går, desto mer förändras det till träsk-område istället för träd och skog. Efter en kort stund av gående så stöter vi på ett ganska mycket större träd och en kompis till den. Detta stora trädet är large och ser ganska mycket läskigare ut än de tidigare.En stund in i fighten lyckas vi ha ihjäl den lite mindre av de två, och strax efter kommer en ny träsnubbe med en hammare. Jimanuel använder en <a href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se?query=tag:Inspiration\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#Inspiration\">#Inspiration</a> i fighten.\nVi får ihjäl alla träd och ska kika ifall vi kan plocka med oss lite coolt trä. Men NÄÄÄÄÄ det går inte för att JACOB tycker att trät GÅR SÖNDER för MYCKET när vi SLÅSS.Jimanuel healar oss lite efter fighten innan vi smyger vidare. Efter en stund ser vi en stoooor stubbe och ett magiskt ljus bakom den. Då kommer oxå en stor drös med pilar mot oss. Ett par bois kommer när vi börjar slåss och vi ser att det är en stooor magisk sten bakom stubben/trädet och några dudes till. Jimanuel skjuter vid ett tillfälle på den stora lysande stenen och när han gjort det blir det ett tydligt märke på stenen och alla fiender vänder sig mot stenen och mot Jimanuel. Jag och Jimanuel downar under fighten, men vi lyckas ha ihjäl alla träden som vi slogs mot. Vi går sedan till den stora stenen som Jimanuel skjutit på och funderar vad vi ska göra med den. Hilmia känner på den för att försöka se vad vi ska göra. “Djupast i träsket finns en övergiven kyrkogård. En förbannad kvinna finns i dess …”Efter att Hilmia pratar klart kommer rötter upp ur marken och lägger fram något orangeat som pulserar. Verkar vara en sten, bärnsten. Hilmia tar upp den och det ser ut som ett hjärta. Vrider man på den ser man att i bärnstenen är det som en vätska som rinner runt i hjärtat. Jag går till magikern vi råkade göra till pulver och häller i en påse. Sen går vi tillbaks och reflekterar lite över vart vi ska gå härnäst. Vi pratar en del på vägen tillbaks och vi upptäcker att halsbandet som Jimanuel har på sig är ett timglas med kvicksilver i. Jag kunde få den om jag fixar ett annat timglas till honom. Hilmia inser också att hon kommer nog vilja ha hjärtat för att hon vill verkligen få känna ett hjärta slå i hennes kropp igen. Så hon tänker attuna till den inatt.Vi går till åldermannen, Tom, för att ge tillbaks nyckeln. Vi möts igen av hans fru som tar emot nyckeln och frågar om vi hittat nåt av värde. Vi frågar om butiker också och det ska finnas lite olika i stan och på marknaden.Strax efter hör vi Tonys röst på håll som ropar “CORY!!”, “ÄR DU KVAAAR?!”.\nVi möts väldigt snart därefter av Tony på en häst som inser att han inte har någon fackla på sig längre så det kommer vara skitmörkt på nätterna, då Cory har haft den. Han ber också om några guldmynt så han kan klara sig, för han är “fattig”. Vi går till tavernan strax efter för att vila lite (short rest) innan vi går runt och handlar. Tavernan är betydligt mycket mer fylld nu på eftermiddagen.\nEn som står ut i mängden är en nästan barbröstad dvärg, väldigt skäggig, röd/vit-hårig. Olof slänger Alarm i osynliga rummet.

Gruppen inhämtade sedan information från jägarna Torvald och Arvid om träskets faror, en kyrkogård, banditernas rörelsemönster och Toms inblandning i \"Knakpulver\". Jägarna försåg även Hilmia och Cory med en sändarsten för kommunikation. Samtidigt etablerade Singwin kontakt med dvärgen Hjalmar Barrelbreaker, vilket krävde en brygd för att förstå hans dvärgiska. Hjalmar, en pensionerad dvärg som besegrat en svart drake i träsket, bad Singwin att undersöka hans trasiga yxa. Efter att förtroende etablerats, lovade Hjalmar att tala allmänsvenska och erbjöd sig att visa den bästa platsen för ett bakhåll mot banditerna. Gruppen handlade även med gnomen Loberta för att skaffa viktiga drycker, inklusive helande drycker och en Potion of Heroism. Efter en lång vila besökte de Hjalmar i hans hem, där han visade upp ett drakhuvud och sin yxa, vars förtrollning behövde återställas med en kraftfull essens. Hjalmar erbjöd en legendarisk natur-essens och starmetal som belöning för reparationen. Slutligen skaffade gruppen en vagn genom att leasa tunnor från bedragaren Örjan Ostholm, varefter Hjalmar ledde dem mot banditernas område för att visa en strategisk plats för ett bakhåll.\n![[]]En lätt skäggig människa klädd i typ en robe har en kniv och lite potions framför sig. Han ser lite lurig ut. Hilmia går fram till han och pratar lite. Han heter Karl. Han är intresserad av att veta vad en viss lysande kristall han har är för något och vart han kan få tag i mer. Hilmia får rolla men Filip tabbar sig när han glömde vår exhaustion tillsammans med att han fick advantage så han använde sin Inspiration retroaktivt.\nDet visar sig vara samma kristall som vi hittade tidigare idag i skogen.\nDe diskuterar lite kring den men kommer inte fram till någon deal. Hilmia kommer tillbaks.Efter kort diskussion mellan oss väljer vi att gå till jägarna för att fråga lite om träsket. Arvid heter den andra jägaren som då inte är Torvald. Vi söker en kyrkogård, varpå de svarar att den är ungefär 1.3km in. Man kan följa ett spår, och följer man det så träffar man inte på riktigt lika mycket bös.\nDe berättar om den bästa vägen in. De säger att det finns allt ifrån \"bengångare\" till \"gengångare\" i träsket. Alltså typ skelett, varulvar o så. De vanligaste man träffar på är saker med massa sporer. De rekommenderar att man tar med något som kan bota lite sjukdomar, man blir lätt sjuk där.. Vi kan gå till Loberta som sitter en bit bort, en Gnome. Hilmia frågar lite gällande banditerna. När det är en lite större grupp så går de alltid norrut, nordöst eller österut. Jag går till den skäggiga dvärgen medan de andra går åt andra håll. Cory och Jimanuel går till Loberta, potion-sellern. Jag försökte prata med dvärgen men det var svårt för han pratade typ enbart på dvärgiska. Bartendern berättar att dvärgen säger att han inte är så förtjust i äventyrare. Han säger också att han har en brygd vi kan dricka för att förstå varandra bättre i en timme.jag går på toa o missar liteHilmia och Cory får en sending stone från jägarna, så vi kan kommunicera kort med varandra om det händer något speciellt som den andra parten kan ha nytta av.Jägarna berättade att Tom har dealat med Knakpulver bakom byns rygg så att säga. Vi funderar på vad vi vill göra först, träsket eller banditerna, och det lutar mot banditerna först. Vi gör det imorn efter vi sovit inatt. Nu går vi istället till Loberta med hennes potions. Cory hade räknat fel på sina pengar så han har inte råd med någon. Jag plockar fram en Squeaky Pleaser och visar henne. Hon blir fascinerad och kan gärna tänka sig byta den mot lite andra potions. Hon tar fram en annan potion som hon kanske tror att vi tycker om. Den kommer göra en varmare, och rent av välsignad i ett par timmar. Efter lite diskussion kommer vi fram till att tradea:\n1 Squeaky Pleaser, 1 Djinn and Tonic (Common), 1/2 handfull Phase-spider-ögon från Astral Plane, 1 Shortrest in a bottle\nemot\n4 Superior Healing potions\n1 Okänd Välsignad potionVi är nöjda där och går tillbaks till Innet för att lägga oss strax. Men jag är lite sugen först på att försöka prata lite med dvärgen Hjalmar innan vi lägger oss. Bartendern säljer den till mig för 10GP (1PP). Funderar lite ifall man kan ge den till Hjalmar för att alla ska kunna förstå honom, men den funkade inte så. Jag sveper den och får \"Limited Tongues\" så jag förstår dvärgiska.Hjalmar Barrelbreaker. Han är pensionerad. The crossroads are not safe, most likely to run into bandits. Vi borde vara nära crossroads.\nHjalmar har vart i träsket och löst ett problem. Han löste en \"liten\" svart drake där. Han har huvudet i sin stuga. Vi kommer in lite på blacksmithing och jag berättar att jag är en blacksmith oxå. Han vill att jag ska titta på hans yxa som är trasig. Blacksmithen i byn är kass tydligen.\nJag pratar mycket med han om massa olika saker och vi säger knasiga saker till varandra. Han litar så pass mycket på mig nu att han kan tänka sig prata Common med mig/oss från och med nu. En stor framgång!Vi ska träffa han imorn innan vi drar mot banditerna så ska han visa vart vi kan få bästa överfallet över dem. Jag identifyar potionen och det var en <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Potions\" data-href=\"Potions\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/06_items/potions.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Potion of Heroism</a>.\nVi går sen o lägger oss och får en long rest. Vi har nu bara Exhaustion 1 kvar.Hjalmar är inte på plats på innet. Cecil säger att han brukar sova längre in på dan. Han säger att vi bara kan gå o knacka på hos han. Vi går dit och knackar. Knackar. Och knackar, och då hör vi något ljud innifrån o sen kommer han och öppnar. Han säger nåt på dvärgiska vi inte fattar (Jag trodde inte alla FYRA skulle va här..... hmmmm).Vi kommer in och ser där ett svart drakhuvud som sitter på väggen. Det var sant. Vi frågar och han säger att den var i träsket, där de brukar va, \"som jag sa igår\". Han tar med oss upp en våning och sätter oss ner. Sen går han för att hämta något, som då är yxan. Det är en stor, lång pinne av sten typ. Mycket större än vad som passar honom. Utöver det har han en diamant. När diamanten ligger rätt så ska det komma ut blad från yxan. Men det funkar inte längre. Efter en 20-roll Arcana fattar jag att det kan va att enchantmenten är borta från diamanten, och att den \"bara\" behöver läggas på igen. Men det krävs en väldigt stark essence.Jag berättar det och han säger att han har ALLT material vi kan behöva. Han gräver i en kista och tar fram en Legendary Nature Essence. Jag frågar vart han fick tag i denna och han svarar bara \"hahahah, jag har MÅNGA till\"!Jag ber om att få kolla i kistan, vilket han tillåter. Jag smyyyyyger mig fram och tittar ner i kistan. Där finns sjuuuukt mycket grejer, mycket organiska material men även en del annat. Jag ser framförallt Crystallized(?) Obsidian, ett material jag bara sett tidigare men aldrig jobbat med. Han går med på att kanske ha det som reward för yxan. Jag föreslår att jag kanske kan få ta med något mer från kistan..... Han går med på det, men säger att han har kanske nåt annat. Han springer ner och hämtar typ 4kg Starmetal. Vi bestämmer oss för att gå så han kan visa. Efter vi kommit ut ur hans hus så låser han, och sen slänger ett par spells mha en nyckel han håller i, innan vi går. Vi går mot vagnen och letar lite grejer vi kan ha i den. Då säger snubben som står framför tunnorna vi kollar på att han äger den. Vi försöker deala lite men märker att han är lite lurig. Jimanuel upptäcker att han är en liten bajs som ljuger, det är inte hans vagn. Örjan Ostholm heter han. Vi fixar en leasing på ett gäng tunnor som Jimanuel dealar ner, som vi då kan fylla vagnen med.Vi, vagnen och Hjalmar går en liten bit och han berättar att när vi följer denna vägen, så kommer vi till ett T-kors. Om vi går norrut så kommer vi strax sen finns ett hål man kan sitta i och agera bete, då man syns på kilometers avstånd.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#session"],"headers":[{"heading":"Current agenda","level":1,"id":"Current_agenda_0"},{"heading":"Goals","level":7,"id":"Goals_0"},{"heading":"Session Summary (AI)","level":1,"id":"Session_Summary_(AI)_0"},{"heading":"Recap of last session","level":1,"id":"Recap_of_last_session_0"},{"heading":"Log","level":1,"id":"Log_0"}],"links":["06_items/potions.html"],"author":"Rasmus","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-61-2026-01-12.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":["05_quests/current-goals-singwin-mistforger.md"],"createdTime":1768234602611,"modifiedTime":1769857724704,"sourceSize":8674,"sourcePath":"02_Journal/Thalbrine - Big campaign/Session 61 - 2026-01-12.md","exportPath":"02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-61-2026-01-12.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":245,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"02_journal/thalbrine-big-campaign/session-62-2026-01-25.html":{"title":"Session 62 - 2026-01-25","icon":"","description":"\nHitta ett sätt att få hem Holger\nFixa ett material med ursprung från the Astral Plane\nHälsa på Semil Wildmagic i Bastion Shore\nKomma på ett namn på byn där Cecil och Arvid finns Gruppen inledde sessionen med att förbereda sig och sedan vänta i en vagn, där Cory var förklädd. De överfölls av dvärgen Torben, som Jimanuel lyckades dominera och förhöra om deras läger. En intern konflikt uppstod när Jimanuel försökte stympa Torben, vilket ledde till att Singwin av misstag dödade dvärgen under strid, vilket i sin tur skapade en spänd stämning mellan dem. Efter att ha lämnat Torben bakom sig, följde de en illusionär stig till en stor hemlig bas. Där infiltrerade de, förhörde en av Gavins män som avslöjade information om basen och en hemlig ingång. De använde ingången för att utforska byggnaden, övermannade flera invånare, hittade ett växtrum och fängelseceller, och avslutade med att storma ett sovrum där de oskadliggjorde de sista motståndarna.\n![[]]Vi börjar av utkanten av byn för att snart åka iväg. Jag kommer på att potiontanten kanske har något emot poisonen som de kan göra på oss. Köper 3st, för 40gp styck. När jag kommer tillbaks visar det sig att det bara är jag och Cory som behöver, så köpte en extra i onödan. Vi följer sedan Hjalmars beskrivningar. Jag, Jimanuel och Hilmia lägger/sätter oss bak i vagnen, medan Cory disguisar sig att se ut som en merchant som kör vagnen. Vi drar till hålet och väntar där typ 30 min. Men vi ser ingenting. Vi föreslår för Cory att han ska se upptagen ut att arbeta på vagnen. Det går en timme till och fortfarande inget. Vi hör ett visslande och Cory som viskar att någon kommer. Det är på väg en rödhårig dvärg med en tvåhandad yxa i hand mot Cory. Hilmia genom hästen ser att det sitter två stycken i trädet ovanför där dvärgen kom ifrån.\nHan hotar Cory och ber honom snällt gå ifrån vagnen så att ingen kommer till skada. Cory går mot hästen.Vi diskuterar i vagnen när vi ska köra, och Jimanuel säger att han vill ta över dvärgen, vilket han gör. Han Dominate Personar dvärgen och lyckas. Dvärgen kastar iväg sitt vapen och går närmare oss och säger “bind fast mig!!”Dvärgen går in i vagnen och lägger sig, så vi enkelt kan binda ihop han. Jag lootar allt han äger och hittar en Satchel med 21GP, 2 knivar, 1 short sword, 1 hand yxa, 1 lesser healing potion.\nHilmia binder honom.Jimanuel försöker få dvärgen till att berätta vart deras camp är. “Det är genom den förtrollade vägen”. Det finns en förtrollad väg i skogen, norr härifrån. Ish en halvtimme max. Finns typ 33 personer i campet, eller 34. Man ska följa svampspåret. Han heter Torben.\nJimanuel vill VÄLDIGT gärna hugga händerna av honom, som “straff” för att han har stulit förr. Cory berättar att Archersarna närmar sig lite så jag tittar försiktigt ut under för att kanske skjuta någon av dem. Men blir snabbt skjuten av en pil när jag tittar och blir poisoned. Då istället för att skjuta dricker jag en av de dära “Anti-poison”-potionen jag köpte. Då försvinner min poison och jag får advantage på framtida poison saves i en timme. Medan vi är lite upptagna med archersarna så börjar Jimanuel hugga av ena handen dvärgen. Då lyckas han också med att ta sig ur Dominate Person. På sin tur sen sliter han sig även ur sina rep vi bundit honom med. Jimanuel slänger Hold Person på han och säger att jag ska skjuta bort hans händer!! Jag vill inte det för de känns fett taskigt när han inte dödat någon utan bara stulit. Jag RÅKAR ha ihjäl honom med exakt damage (eller inte men frickade upp räkningen). Då blir Jimanuel fett arg och slänger Command på mig med ordet “SKÄMS!” <a href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se?query=tag:inspiration\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#inspiration\">#inspiration</a> till Jimanuel för det. Jag stenfailar den med en nat-1:a. I respons går jag o sätter mig i ett hörn i vagnen och skäms. En av de två archersarna löses också, men den sista lyckades fly. Torben, dvärgen, sätter sig upp ish och låter lite. Diskussion sker mellan Singwin och Jimanuel. Singwin förstår inte helt poängen med att hugga händerna av honom och säger att det inte var meningen att döda honom. Jimanuels försvar var endast att “du vet varför!!??!” men Singwin känner inte att han vet så säger nej. Men det går inte Jimanuel med på. Jimanuel anser att Singwin är respektlös mot honom men Singe vet inte vad han har gjort. Singwin försöker fråga men får bara icke-svar som respons.Vi knockar dvärgen Torben och lämnar han vid ett buskage. Vi skickar hem hästen med vagnen och vi börjar gå norrut och leta efter svamparna Torben nämnde. Hilmia hittar dem efter en stund och inspekterar svamparna. Hon inser och uppmärksammar att stora delar av där vi befinner oss är illusioner.\nVi fortsätter följa svamparna och de leder till slut till en klippvägg. Hilmia tror att det måste bara vara fejk. Så hon går rakt fram och rakt igenom väggen; men hon möts först av något som känns som klippan men kommer sedan igenom, men vi kan inte höra henne längre. Jimanuel hänger efter igenom där. Jag o Cory är kvar. Han säger att jag får prova nu, men jag svarar och berättar att jag tycker det känns jättejobbigt mellan mig och Jimanuel. Jag tycker det var väldigt jobbigt hur det blev mellan oss. Så vi pratar lite om det innan jag går igenom (vi får veta sen att när man gått igenom kan man fortfarande höra de som pratar utanför).Det är ingen klippa här alls utan bara skog. Det är alltså mycket illusioner bara.\nVi följer svamparna och kommer tills vi ser ett SUPERstort hus på säkert 1000-tals kvadratmeter. Finns en del tält o grejer utanför. Det börjar regna. Sjukt mycket. Vi går runt huset och letar vägar in som känns vettiga. Försöker speja omkring lite.\nVi lyssnar på ett par dörrar och vissa är tysta, vissa är lite ljudliga inuti. På andra sidan ser vi ett stall typ med en owlbear i som äter något. Vi vänder och tar en annan dörr.När vi går in i vad som verkar vara smedjan hör vi en röst; “Torben, är det du?” hör vi en röst säga. Vi går närmare och möter rösten, där Jimanuel i respons slänger Hold Person och vi binder fast honom. Jag slänger ihop någon form av handklovar vi monterar på hans händer. Vi pratar med honom lite när Hold Person tar slut. Jimanuel slänger Zone of Truth. Vi ställer lite frågor.<br>\n<a data-href=\"Gavin\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Gavin</a> är den 34:e personen. En magiker, bard. Han styr inte hela stället, men han har anställt banditerna. Han är dock inte en bandit själv. Hela byggnaden är hans. Han brukar finnas här. “något spetsöra, skägglöst”. Han har ett sovrum på andra sidan byggnaden. Det finns fällor i huset, paneler. Om man trycker ned dem så skjuter pilar. Det finns också två kistor, som inte är fällor. De är förbi stallet säger han. Hilmia frågar om han försöker lura oss och då svarar han “ja”. <br><a data-href=\"Gavin\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Gavin</a> vill vara här för att det finns en krigsherre här som han vill åt.

Han föreslår att vi går runt på andra sidan för att slippa det mesta. “Tegelsten två ner, tre till höger.”Jimanuel föreslår att de arbetar med smedjeriet på heltid. Men de kan inte närma sig en storstad för att de är lite efterlysta. Vi kanske kan hjälpa dem, Galgram och Torben. Hooks inn kan vi höra av oss till för att hjälpa dem. Han hänger med oss ut och går sen ut ur skogen. Vi går sen runt åt andra hållet gentemot Owlbearen.Vi hittar en liten smal gränd och följer in. Där ser vi en markerad tegelsten. Tegelstenen två steg ner och tre till höger trycker Jimanuel på och då öppnas en dörr. Vi kommer till ett hemligt litet rum där vi kan igenom baksidan på en bokhylla komma till ett annat rum där det fanns två som läser.\nYtterligare ser vi en till springa som ledde till ett mycket större rum i mitten av huset typ. Där fanns typ 4-5 personer + den stora vargen vi slogs mot när vi anlände från the Astral Plane. De står runt ett stort bord med ritningar och grejer på.Vi väljer att kolla fler dörrar. Hittar en som leder till ett växtrum typ, med massa växter de odlar. Växter som inte egentligen hör hemma här. Hilmia plockar en bok med titeln “Advanced Herbal Studies”.\nHär finns ytterligare en dörr där det står någon innanför som gör något med någon form av trä. Oklart vad.Vi kollar en annan väg där vi behöver använda en nyckel som var i samma rum. Där inne var celler, fängelseceller.Bestämmer oss för att gå tillbaks till biblioteket typ där de läste böcker. Vi oskadliggör dem och lägger i fängelsehålan. Försöker hitta något av intresse sen i rummet. Det är bara skrinet typ, som är låst och vi inte har nyckel till. Jag lägger det i Bagge. Utöver det hittar vi en lapp med massa boknamn på där många är avkryssade. Kanske letar de efter något i någon bok?Men vi hittar inget mer i rummet. Går till sista dörren vi känner till och känns rimlig; längst ner till vänster. Kommer till ett litet rum och en korridor. Där inne finns några fler dörrar sen. Vi öppnar en av dem och det leder till ett sovrum där det ligger ett par stycken. Jimanuel går in själv först och stänger dörren bakom sig och säger sen “Vi vill er inget illa” med händerna uppe. “Jag vill bara ha åt Barden (Gavin). Och hjälpa er att få ett bättre liv”.\nEn av dem heter Bellman. Diskussion fortgår.Det går inte som Jimanuel tänker riktigt så han säger “Jag önskar att det inte hade behövt bli såhär” medan han öppnar upp dörren bakom sig och vi rusar in. Vi bankar ner dem och lägger dem i sina sängar. Sen låser vi dörren bakom.

Legend says the Pale Aleomancers, led by famous brewer Jan Smyth, titrated themselves to reach the perfect level of drunkenness. In the short time thereafter, conflicts between long-warring nations were resolved, a universal healthcare system was established that delivered free care at the point of need, and the eternal question of why the gobboc crossed the road was answered. To celebrate their achievement, they finished their pint. In the slightly-more-inebriated aftermath, all their hard work was undone and the world descended into chaos once more. Since then, Aleomancers the world over have kept their titrating techniques a closely guarded secret.Between long rests, a creature can drink a number of units of alcohol equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum 0) without any effect. For each unit of alcohol the creature drinks beyond this, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw, calculating the DC using the formula below.Drunkenness saving throw DC = 10 + number of units of alcohol consumed since last long restOn a failed saving throw, a creature gains 1 level of drunkenness. Drunkenness is measured in six levels. If an already drunk creature suffers another effect that causes drunkenness, its current level of drunkenness increases by the number of units of alcohol the creature consumed to trigger the saving throw.A creature’s drunkenness level is reduced by 1 for each 2 hours since it last drank. Furthermore, finishing a long rest reduces a creature’s drunkenness level to 0.A creature suffers the effect of its current level of drunkenness as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 3 drunkenness has disadvantage on Dexterity, Charisma, and Wisdom checks and saving throws.Prerequisite: The creature loses at least 1 level of drunkenness during or as a result of finishing a long rest.When this occurs, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of the long rest. The DC for this saving throw equals four times the drunkenness level before they started the long rest. A creature that fails this saving throw has a hangover and is poisoned for a number of hours equal to the difference between the result of their saving throw and the DC.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Drinking &amp; Drunkenness","level":1,"id":"Drinking_&_Drunkenness_0"},{"heading":"Condition: <strong>Drunk</strong>","level":1,"id":"Condition_**Drunk**_0"},{"heading":"Drunkenness &amp; Effects","level":1,"id":"Drunkenness_&_Effects_0"},{"heading":"Optional Rule: <strong>Hangover</strong>","level":1,"id":"Optional_Rule_**Hangover**_0"}],"links":[],"author":"Rasmus","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"thalbrine.knasingen.se/94_character_creation/mechanics/drinking-&-drunkenness.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1769627019498,"modifiedTime":1769627505258,"sourceSize":3345,"sourcePath":"94_Character_Creation/Mechanics/Drinking & Drunkenness.md","exportPath":"94_character_creation/mechanics/drinking-&-drunkenness.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":291,"backlinks":["index.html"],"type":"markdown"},"94_character_creation/spells/acid-rain.html":{"title":"Acid Rain","icon":"","description":"3rd-level ConjurationCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 90 feet (20-foot-radius, 60-foot-tall cylinder)\nComponents: V, S, M (a drop of acid)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nClass: Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard\nSourcebook: Heliana's Guide to Monster HuntingWith a gentle patter, corrosive raindrops build to an acidic deluge in a 20-foot-radius, 60-foot-tall cylinder, centred on a point within range.

63 - 2026-02-01","icon":"","description":"\nHitta ett sätt att få hem Holger\nFixa ett material med ursprung från the Astral Plane\nHälsa på Semil Wildmagic i Bastion Shore\nKomma på ett namn på byn där Cecil och Arvid finns Vi konfronterade Gavin och lade Zone of Truth över rummet. Han talade sanning. Det visade sig att han och Singwin för cirka 20 år sedan var i samma äventyrarparty tillsammans med Ness och Martin – och att Singwin enligt Gavin mördade dem båda innan han försvann. Gavin trodde att Singwin kommit tillbaka för att mörda honom också.Gavin förklarade att han inte leder banditerna utan finansierar dem för att sabotera transporter kopplade till Lord Highroad. Den riktige Lord Highroad är död och har ersatts av en impostor som producerar Black Tar och förser västfronten med både material och information. Gavins mål är att försvaga honom genom logistisk kvävning utan att tvinga fram en öppen konfrontation som skulle få honom att fly bakom orchernas linjer.Vi insåg att situationen är mer politiskt komplex än vi först trodde och föreslog möjlig kontakt med Gideon. Gavin var försiktigt öppen för idén.Vi lämnade tillbaka de flesta föremål vi tagit från huset (runskrin, scrollar, bok, frön m.m.). Trots misstro mot Singwin lät Gavin oss stanna över natten för att kunna kontakta Gideon.Sessionen avslutades med att Gavin visade sitt förråd av rikedomar och magiska föremål, delade ut gåvor till Jimanuel, Cory och Hilmia – men inte till Singwin – och låste in sig ovanför oss.Gruppen inledde sessionen med att förbereda sig och sedan vänta i en vagn, där Cory var förklädd. De överfölls av dvärgen Torben, som Jimanuel lyckades dominera och förhöra om deras läger. En intern konflikt uppstod när Jimanuel försökte stympa Torben, vilket ledde till att Singwin av misstag dödade dvärgen under strid, vilket i sin tur skapade en spänd stämning mellan dem. Efter att ha lämnat Torben bakom sig, följde de en illusionär stig till en stor hemlig bas. Där infiltrerade de, förhörde en av Gavins män som avslöjade information om basen och en hemlig ingång. De använde ingången för att utforska byggnaden, övermannade flera invånare, hittade ett växtrum och fängelseceller, och avslutade med att storma ett sovrum där de oskadliggjorde de sista motståndarna.\nVi fortsätter leta i huset.\nVi känner på en av de två dörrarna men den är låst. Nycklarna vi hade funkade inte där heller. Vi provade den andra dörren, vilken en av nycklarna funkade till. Där inne var bara ett sovrum. Jimanuel hittar ett skrin till. Skrinet har symboler på sig men inte något nyckelhål.\nJag ser att det är runor runt om en cirkulär liksom “snurra”, som liknar en sån på ett kassaskåp. Vi behöver nog lista ut vad runorna är innan vi kan öppna.\nSista dörren här verkar också leda till ett sovrum. Vi väljer att gå runt o prova en annan väg. När Jimanuel går in där genom dörren så går han ett par steg in på en matta men han märker att hans fot faller igenom. Han lyckas upptäcka det i tid och ta sig ifrån, innan mattan faller ner i en grop med spikar i botten.Resten av rummet har mängder av tomma hyllor runtomkring överallt och det finns en stor karta på ett skrivbord här, som vi tydligt kommer fram till inte är över detta huset. Det kanske är från byggnaden som Barden ville typ attackera. Kartan verkar bestå av något tunnelsystem. Hilmia tar upp en fundering, hon är i stort behov av ett fokus. Vi gräver lite efter grejer o ser om vi har något. Jimanuels gå-pinne verkar till slut funka. Hilmia ger sin egna gå-pinne till honom så han kan fortsätta gå. Vi går till dubbeldörren som var nära smedjan. Den visar sig bara innehålla ett litet rum med massa lådor. Hilmia klättrar över och lyssnar på dörren som är på motsatt sida där vi öppnade. Dörren var svåröppnad och gick inte att få upp mer än någon cm. Det verkar vara en korridor där igenom. Cory klättrar över och försöker samma sak. Han tar i ordentligt och får upp dörren, men det låter rätt mycket i gengäld. Jimanuel försöker gå över lådorna också men lyckas inte, han snubblar och trillar på rygg. Endast ett par decimeter ifrån en björnfälla. Jag tittar på björnfällan för att se ifall jag kan fixa att “montera isär” den så man kan ta med den. Men känner inte att jag löser det på ett bra sätt och jag blir orolig istället och låter den vara. Tänk om det finns massa fler fällor??Finns en dörr söderut i den korridoren som vi öppnar och går in i. I det rummet finnas massor av kartor på ställen i Aarid Province. Rummet är rätt bösigt och hög chans för masa insekter som äter både trä och papper.Vi kommer till ytterligare ett rum efter det. I ena dörren som finns i det rummet hör vi nån kniv/svärd som möter kött av något slag. Kanske en Butcher. Lyssnar på andra dörren och det låter som det kanske också är det stora vardagsrummet som hade ett gött gäng banditer i sig runt något bord.Vi öppnar dörren till vad som kanske är slaktrummet. Snubben där inne reagerar på att vi kommer in. Han kastar kniven emot Jimanuel som missar. Cory svarar på det med att banka honom en gång. Vi andra går in sen o stänger dörren nästan hela vägen, jag håller dörren lite öppen på glänt så kan jag se om något händer med den andra dörren. Jimanuel pratar med slaktaren sen lite och försöker övertyga honom om att dra härifrån. Jimanuel “anställer” slaktaren till sin “herrgård” på Divided Wilds vilket han faktiskt går med på. Jimanuel ger han alldeles för lite pengar för att ta sig dit och riktigt dåliga beskrivningar om vart han ska. Slaktarn packar ihop sina grejer över någon minut innan han drar. Under tiden ställer Hilmia lite frågor om Barden. Vi får veta att han bor på andra våningen och att han är en alv, eller halv-alv.Han springer ut och då börjar jag fundera på om vi ska springa till han o säga till om fällan vi flyttade på. Men jag hinner inte tänka klart innan vi hör ett vrål. Det måste vara han som råkade fastna i björnfällan Jimanuel flyttade på.\nVi stänger till dörren som går till slakteriet och gömmer oss. 2 snubbar går förbi. Vi går ut och börjar följa dem, men bara Jimanuel och Cory hinner.\nSen hör Hilmia att fler kommer från vardagsrummet. Vi hinner inte gömma oss helt. Hilmia står bakom dörren som öppnas, jag försöker ta mig till slakteriet, men hinner inte.\nDörren öppnas och jag står rakt i synfältet på han som öppnade dörren. Direkt då hörs en busvissling och man kan höra fler som går.Rollar initiativ. När det är min tur så säger jag bara att jag är ute efter Barden, och jag räcker upp händerna. I respons på det så tar han upp en imaginär pilbåge och siktar på mig. Han gungar massa och verkar rätt full. Jag säger att jag inte är på riktigt och att han drömmer. Han svarar att “det blir kyckling till middag!”. En person längre in frågar om det var någon där, och han som “sköt” mig säger att “det var en liten fågel!!”.Jimanuel går mot där björnfällan fanns, och ser att han vi “hjälpte” ut inte sitter fast i fällan längre utan det är dvärgen, en av de som gick förbi nyss.\nHan gör de två banditerna blinda som står just nu och försöker få ut dvärgen som fastnat.Jag lyckas gömma mig i slakteriet lite, tills han kommer och går in och då tar jag min chans att smyga mig ut ur slakteriet och stänger dörren. Han verkar fortsätta leta i slakteriet. Hilmia som vid detta laget är en spindel och hon klättrar ner på mig och vi går tillsammans ut mot Cory och Jimanuel. Vi möter dem, och bestämmer oss för att ta oss till Växthuset. Vi går ut genom förrådet med lådor och möter banditerna. Jimanuel lossar sin Concentration på Blindness och låtsas som att han fixade dem med sin magi. Han försöker övertala dem att han kan erbjuda dem jobb också. Men lyckas inte helt. De berättar dock att skriket som hördes lät som Simon, slaktaren och lät norrifrån. Vi inser att han kanske försökte ta en häst men fick lite problem med Owlbearen som befinner sig där…Vi kommer överens med dem att de låter oss va om vi låter dem va. Så vi delar på oss och vi går åt olika håll. Vi går till växthuset igen nu för att försöka hitta en väg upp till Bardens rum. Vi lyssnar på den enda dörren som finns men hör inget, så vi öppnar. Det verkar vara mest verktyg o grejer där inne. Strängar och trä o sånt för att skapa instrument av.\nDetta rummet har en dörr i som leder till ett större rum en liten trappa ner för ytterligare förvaring. Längst bort i rummet finns en liten trappa ner med en ganska liten dörr nedanför, typ 1.2m hög bara. Denna dörr leder till slutet av korridor som vi tidigare kollat i, så inget nytt där i. Vi går tillbaks ut och letar ännu mer efter en väg upp i växthuset. Hittar ingenting. Cory kollar utanför och märker att det finns en högre del på detta huset. Så han hoppar upp och vi alla tar oss upp på ett eller annat sätt, då ingen lyckades klättra själva på repet Cory släppte ner. Jimanuel binder fast sig och Cory drar upp honom. Jag Misty Steppar upp och Hilmia blir uppdragen av oss alla sen.\nVi börjar gå mot delen av huset som är extra högt. Det är blött och halt på taket men vi kan gå ganska bra ändå. När vi går runt och försöker hitta en ingång så ser vi sen att precis utanför stallet ligger ett lik på vad som verkar vara Slaktaren Simon. Han har nog blivit dödad av Owlbearen. Jag använder Detect Magic när vi går där. Som tur var är inte väggarna för tjocka för att känna av Conjuration Magic. Vi går ett varv runt igen för att se om jag känner något mer. Conjuration är tätt packat runtom hela “huset” där. Kan vara så att innehållet i rummet är conjurat fram så det blir ett specifikt innehåll.\nVi bestämmer oss för att försöka köra på bara. Jag öppnar med Passwall. Passwall håller i 1 timme. Vi går in. Rummet är typ 7,5x7,5 m stort rum. Det har en stor kristall en trappa ner med ett gäng braziers runt om som lyser i otherworldly färger.På golvet finns ett stort pergament med Arcane-symboler. Det är någon form av ritual igång. Jag försöker kolla på pergamentet om vad det handlar om, ritualen är inte en 1-time-use, utan den håller länge. Jag förstår dock att kristallen där används antagligen som bränsle.\nJag plockar 3 av de extra scrollsen som låg vid sidan av och Identifyar en av dem för att se vad det handlar om. Jimanuel sa att det är nån form av Tranportation-magi.Cory och Hilmia går en trappa upp och kikar där. Ingen är där, men de kan se fotspår och tecken på att någon vart här säkert senaste 30 minutrarna. Här uppe finns en hel del papper och allt verkar vara Writs of Purchase där alla har samma sigill på sig. Dessa är transportbeställningar typ, med blandade saker så som, armors, vapen, sköldar, matvaror, knakpulver och black tar/svarttjära. Black Tar är det som Orcherna använder på fronten av kriget.Jag identifierar klart pergamentet som ”Scroll of Lasting Gateway”. En spell jag inte kan men jag förstår syftet. Man använder den för att sätta en form av portal mellan två platser på max 500ft distans. Den håller i 30 dagar. Man använder en fras för att föra sig mellan platserna. Jag och Jimanuel går sen upp för att komma till Cory och Hilmia. Vi diskuterar lite gällande trade-contractsen och om det är så att denna snubben här gör något gott?? För han verkar stoppa trade routes som bl.a innehåller black tar, knakpulver osv.Vi går upp en våning till och kommer till ett bibliotek med tusentals böcker av massa olika sorter; musik, berättelser, historia och annat. Vi går ganska raskt vidare bara. När vi kommer upp så ser vi en bard, Gavin, med en luta sitta på en pall med benen i kors. Han inspekterar oss väldigt väldigt noga. Han verkligen vill ha koll på allt vi har på oss.\nHan tittar noga på mig. Och det verkar som att han känner igen mig. Han säger det med. ”Hur har du övertygat dem om att följa med dig hit?”. Vi verkar ha träffats förut. ”Att du kommer hit igen med samma rustning”… ”Har du kommit för att mörda mig också?”Jag poängterar att jag inte vet vem han är, att jag inte heller jobbar som jag gjorde förut. ”Ah, som lönnmördare menar du?”. Gällande armoren så är det nog samma som andra Feathrens har när man jobbar för Stora G.\nJag nämner att jag är brevbärare nu, och slår på väskan. ”aha, en sån brevbärare…”Jag, <a data-href=\"Gavin\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/gavin.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Gavin</a>, Martin(namn..?) och Mer(eller vad namnet var) har tydligen vart i party tillsammans som äventyrare länge. Men någonting har hänt och han påstår att jag har rent av mördat både Martin och Ness. Därför trodde han att jag skulle ha ihjäl honom också. Att det är därför jag kom hit. När han pratade om våra f.d. partymedlemmar blev han blank i ögonen och släppte några tårar.\nGavin spelade på mitt bröllop och på min frus begravning.\nSpelar in ljud här för de händer för mycket.\n<br>Zone of Truth lades på <a data-href=\"Gavin\" href=\"thalbrine.knasingen.se/03_npcs/gavin.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Gavin</a>.

Singwin fick inget.Han betalar banditerna för att stoppa vissa beställningar. Han vill stoppa kriget som den f.d. ”Lord Highroad” bistår med material till, på Orchernas sida. Men den Lord Highroad man känner till finns inte längre, det är nog inte den man tror. Antagligen har Tom från byn och Minara, hon som bestämmer över banditerna, lite tvister mellan sig. Och det är nog det som gör att Tom vill stoppa detta. Gavin säger att innan jag börjar söka oändlig makt igen så borde jag vara försiktig med Stora G.
